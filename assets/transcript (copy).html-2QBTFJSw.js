and<br> 00:02:13.200 skinning from an arbitrary single static<br> 00:02:15.360 3d mesh is not easy</p><p><strong>skeleton</strong></p><p>00:02:18.080 one challenge is that character and can vary a lot in number of parts and the overall structure as i show here in this animator graded rigs</p><p><strong>skinning</strong></p><p>00:02:28.640 similarly when computing skinning<br> 00:02:30.319 weights animator will perceive<br> 00:02:32.400 structures as highly rigid or smoother<br> 00:02:35.360 for example<br> 00:02:36.560 here i visualize the skeleton of a nail<br> 00:02:38.640 character<br> 00:02:39.920 the skinning waist on the shell moves<br> 00:02:41.599 rigidly as a whole according to the bone<br> 00:02:43.519 here<br> 00:02:45.360 well the rest of the body deforms more<br> 00:02:47.280 smoothly according to the rest of the<br> 00:02:48.840 bone<br> 00:02:50.080 a learning method should capture the<br> 00:02:51.599 skinning variability</p><p><strong>level of detail</strong></p><p>00:02:54.319 finally another challenge for ring<br> 00:02:56.480 method is to allow easy and direct<br> 00:02:58.159 control<br> 00:02:58.720 over the level of detail for the output<br> 00:03:00.239 skeleton<br> 00:03:02.000 as you can see from this animator<br> 00:03:03.599 created rigs<br> 00:03:05.519 well animators largely agree on skeletal<br> 00:03:07.920 topology and layout of joints for an<br> 00:03:09.840 input character<br> 00:03:11.440 there is also some ambiguity both in<br> 00:03:13.200 terms of the number and exact joint<br> 00:03:15.120 placement</p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overview"><span>Overview</span></a></h2><p>to address these challenges, RigNet propose the deep learning architecture with three modules</p><ol><li><p>00:03:22.480</p><p>firstly, we apply a skeletal joint prediction module which is trained to predict the appropriate number of joints and their placement to capture the articulated mobility of input capture as skeletal joint resolution can depend on the intended animation task we provide users an optional parameter that can control the level of detail of the output skeleton</p></li><li><p>00:03:43.680</p><p>second, to form a skeleton from the predictive joints we apply a skeleton connectivity module to predict the hierarchical tree structure connecting the joints the output bone structure is a function of predicted joints and shape feature of the input capture</p></li><li><p>00:03:59.760</p><p>finally, we apply a skinning prediction module to produce skinning weight indicating the degree of influence each vertex receives from different bones</p></li></ol><p>all these modules are trained in a supervised manner from character rigs mind online i&#39;ll describe input and each module one by one</p><h2 id="joint-prediction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#joint-prediction"><span>Joint Prediction</span></a></h2><p>00:04:20.000 the input to the entire network is a<br> 00:04:21.759 single 3d model in its mesh<br> 00:04:23.440 representation<br> 00:04:25.040 our approach operates directly on the<br> 00:04:26.960 input mesh</p><h3 id="architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture"><span>Architecture</span></a></h3><p>00:04:29.040 the first module of our architecture<br> 00:04:31.120 joint prediction module<br> 00:04:32.560 is trained to predict the location of<br> 00:04:34.320 joints that will be used to form the<br> 00:04:36.080 animation skeleton<br> 00:04:38.400 to this end it learns to displace mesh<br> 00:04:40.720 geometry towards candidate<br> 00:04:42.000 joint locations the module is based on a<br> 00:04:45.600 neural network<br> 00:04:46.800 which extracts topology and geometry<br> 00:04:48.880 aware features from the mesh to learn<br> 00:04:50.639 these displacements<br> 00:04:53.199 at the same time we also learn a weight<br> 00:04:55.199 function over the input mesh<br> 00:04:56.880 which is used to reveal which surface<br> 00:04:58.639 areas are more relevant for localizing joints<br> 00:05:01.759 this can be seen as a form of neural<br> 00:05:03.440 mesh attention<br> 00:05:05.600 after that we introduce a differentiable<br> 00:05:08.160 clustering scheme<br> 00:05:09.600 which uses both displaced vertices and<br> 00:05:11.600 the neural mesh attention<br> 00:05:13.120 to collapse the vertices further to<br> 00:05:14.960 potential positions of the joints<br> 00:05:18.240 since areas with higher point density<br> 00:05:20.240 and greater mesh attention are strong<br> 00:05:22.080 indicators of joint presence<br> 00:05:24.479 with results to mean shift clustering<br> 00:05:26.639 and then maximum separation to extract<br> 00:05:28.400 joints<br> 00:05:30.160 in classical mean shift clustering each<br> 00:05:32.400 data point is equipped with the kernel<br> 00:05:34.400 function<br> 00:05:35.520 at each iteration all points are shifted<br> 00:05:37.919 towards density modes<br> 00:05:40.000 here we show the mean shift equation<br> 00:05:43.199 we employ a variant of mean shift<br> 00:05:44.960 clustering where the kernel is also<br> 00:05:46.960 modulated by the vertex attention<br> 00:05:49.919 in this manner points with greater<br> 00:05:52.080 attention influence the estimation of<br> 00:05:53.600 density more<br> 00:05:55.039 here we show the shift equation in our<br> 00:05:57.039 implementation<br> 00:05:59.680 we use epinephrine curve kernel in our<br> 00:06:01.840 implementation<br> 00:06:03.280 note that the kernel function takes the<br> 00:06:04.800 parameter h as bandwidth<br> 00:06:07.039 the bandwidth can be learned<br> 00:06:08.240 simultaneously as we turn the network<br> 00:06:11.039 the bandwidth also allow optional user<br> 00:06:12.880 control on the level of detail<br> 00:06:14.639 or granularity of the output skeleton<br> 00:06:18.080 we found that modifying the bandwidth<br> 00:06:19.759 directly affects the level of detail of<br> 00:06:21.520 the output skeleton</p><h3 id="bandwidth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bandwidth"><span>Bandwidth</span></a></h3><p>00:06:23.360 here is an example lowering the<br> 00:06:26.000 bandwidth parameter results in denser<br> 00:06:27.919 joint placement<br> 00:06:29.600 will increase it results in sparse<br> 00:06:31.440 skeleton<br> 00:06:33.039 by overriding the learned bandwidth<br> 00:06:35.280 users can adjust the results to their<br> 00:06:37.440 preference</p><h3 id="architecture-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture-1"><span>Architecture</span></a></h3><p>00:06:39.360 at test time the mode centers of<br> 00:06:41.360 clusters are extracted with no maximum<br> 00:06:43.280 separation as the final detected joins<br> 00:06:46.560 now we&#39;ll discuss more details about the<br> 00:06:48.479 networks used to learn the vertex<br> 00:06:50.160 displacement and attention<br> 00:06:52.960 we call this network gmh net<br> 00:06:56.000 the main operation of this network is<br> 00:06:57.840 geodesic mesh convolution which we call<br> 00:06:59.840 gmh curve</p><h3 id="gmedgeconv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gmedgeconv"><span>GMEdgeConv</span></a></h3><p>00:07:02.479 the gmh convolution is inspired by the h<br> 00:07:05.199 convolution in d g<br> 00:07:06.479 c and n the main difference is that our<br> 00:07:09.440 operators is applied to meshes and<br> 00:07:11.360 geodesic numbers<br> 00:07:13.360 specifically given the surface vertex<br> 00:07:16.880 we consider its one ring mesh neighbors<br> 00:07:19.280 and also the vertices located within the<br> 00:07:21.199 geodesic board centered at it<br> 00:07:24.400 we also found it&#39;s better to learn<br> 00:07:25.840 separate mlps for mesh and geodesic<br> 00:07:28.160 neighborhoods<br> 00:07:29.759 and then concatenate their outputs and<br> 00:07:31.840 process them through another mlp<br> 00:07:34.319 in this manner the networks learn to<br> 00:07:36.560 weight the importance of topology aware<br> 00:07:38.319 feature<br> 00:07:38.800 over more geometry aware ones</p><h3 id="gmedgenet" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gmedgenet"><span>GMEdgeNet</span></a></h3><p>00:07:42.560 in gmhnet we stack three gmh cuff layers<br> 00:07:46.639 each of the gmh cuff layers is followed<br> 00:07:49.039 by a global max pooling layer<br> 00:07:51.599 the representation from each pooling<br> 00:07:53.520 layers are concatenated to form a global<br> 00:07:55.840 mesh representation<br> 00:07:58.000 the vertex representations from all gmh<br> 00:08:00.960 curve layers<br> 00:08:02.080 as well as the global mesh<br> 00:08:03.440 representation are further concatenated<br> 00:08:06.879 than processed through a three layer mlp<br> 00:08:09.039 to output the vertex attributes<br> 00:08:11.199 either the displacement or the attention<br> 00:08:15.280 with all the components introduced above<br> 00:08:17.599 we have built the complete joint<br> 00:08:18.960 prediction mode which detects joints<br> 00:08:20.639 from a single input mesh</p><h3 id="training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#training"><span>Training</span></a></h3><p>00:08:23.360 the training of the joint prediction<br> 00:08:24.800 module consists of two steps<br> 00:08:27.280 in the first step we pre-treat the word<br> 00:08:29.520 extension module with heuristically<br> 00:08:31.440 generated ground truth masks<br> 00:08:32.958 as you&#39;ll see on the right the masks are<br> 00:08:35.760 1 as you&#39;ll see here in red and blue for<br> 00:08:37.839 zeros<br> 00:08:39.360 for each training mesh we find vertices<br> 00:08:41.679 closest to each joint at different<br> 00:08:43.519 directions perpendicular to the bones<br> 00:08:46.160 we use cross entropy to measure<br> 00:08:47.920 consistency between the masks and the<br> 00:08:49.680 neural tension<br> 00:08:51.839 in the second step we minimize the<br> 00:08:53.839 symmetric transfer distance<br> 00:08:55.440 between collapsed vertices and the<br> 00:08:57.040 training joints<br> 00:08:58.880 the loss is differentiable with regard<br> 00:09:00.720 to all the parameters of the joint<br> 00:09:02.320 prediction stage<br> 00:09:03.680 including the bandwidth the displacement<br> 00:09:06.000 network and the attention network<br> 00:09:08.880 we found that adding supervisory signal<br> 00:09:10.800 to the vertex displacements before<br> 00:09:12.560 clustering<br> 00:09:13.360 help improves joint detection<br> 00:09:14.959 performance<br> 00:09:16.720 to this end we also minimize transfer<br> 00:09:19.040 distance between displaced<br> 00:09:20.480 points and ground truth joints firing<br> 00:09:23.040 tighter clusters</p><h2 id="connectivity-prediction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#connectivity-prediction"><span>Connectivity Prediction</span></a></h2><p>00:09:26.320 given the joints extracted from the<br> 00:09:28.160 previous stage the connectivity<br> 00:09:30.160 prediction module determines how these<br> 00:09:32.000 joints should be connected<br> 00:09:33.440 to form the animation skeleton at the</p><p>00:09:36.080 heart of the stage<br> 00:09:37.040 lines a learned neural module that<br> 00:09:38.720 outputs the probability of connecting<br> 00:09:40.560 each pair of joints via a bone<br> 00:09:43.360 such module we call bone net takes as<br> 00:09:46.399 input our predicted joints along with<br> 00:09:48.800 the input mesh<br> 00:09:50.160 and outputs the probability for<br> 00:09:51.760 connecting each pair of joints via boom<br> 00:09:55.200 the architecture of the module is shown<br> 00:09:57.040 in the green box<br> 00:09:59.360 for each pair of joints the module<br> 00:10:01.519 processes three representations<br> 00:10:04.320 first we capture the skeleton geometry<br> 00:10:06.640 with the point net operating on the<br> 00:10:08.160 joint locations<br> 00:10:09.760 then we capture the global shape<br> 00:10:11.200 geometry with our mesh network<br> 00:10:14.000 and finally an mlp for each candidate<br> 00:10:16.240 phone<br> 00:10:17.600 the bone probability is computed via a<br> 00:10:19.839 two layer mlp operating on the<br> 00:10:21.440 concatenation of these three<br> 00:10:22.959 representations<br> 00:10:26.000 besides pairwise connectivity<br> 00:10:27.600 probability we also selected the root<br> 00:10:29.920 joint<br> 00:10:30.560 using a neural module called roonette<br> 00:10:33.600 its internal architecture follows<br> 00:10:35.279 boomnet<br> 00:10:37.360 with this pairwise bone probabilities<br> 00:10:39.440 and the predicted route as the starting<br> 00:10:41.200 node<br> 00:10:41.839 we apply prime&#39;s algorithm to create a<br> 00:10:44.160 minimum spanning tree presenting the<br> 00:10:45.760 animation skeleton<br> 00:10:47.680 we found that using these bone<br> 00:10:49.040 probabilities to extract the mst<br> 00:10:51.839 resulted in

skinny<br> 00:17:21.919 waste prediction<br> 00:17:24.559 our approach doesn&#39;t make assumption<br> 00:17:26.240 about the input on shape class and<br> 00:17:27.839 structure<br> 00:17:29.200 therefore it can be generalized to<br> 00:17:31.120 characters with varying structure and<br> 00:17:32.880 morphology<br> 00:17:34.960 our approach also provides a single<br> 00:17:36.640 parameter that users can tune to control<br> 00:17:38.799 the output granularity<br> 00:17:41.360 our approach does have limitations and<br> 00:17:43.679 exciting avenues for future work<br> 00:17:46.400 first our method currently use a per<br> 00:17:48.799 stage training approach<br> 00:17:50.880 ideally the skinning loss could be back<br> 00:17:53.360 propagated to all states of network<br> 00:17:55.520 to improve joint prediction second<br> 00:17:59.200 our data set has the limitations it can<br> 00:18:01.679 turns one rig promoter<br> 00:18:04.160 many rigs often don&#39;t include bones for<br> 00:18:06.240 small parts<br> 00:18:07.280 like feet fingers clothing and<br> 00:18:10.480 accessories which makes our train model<br> 00:18:13.280 less<br> 00:18:13.600 predictive for these joints<br> 00:18:17.280 finally our current bandwidth parameter<br> 00:18:19.440 explores one mode of<br> 00:18:20.559 variation exploring a richer space to<br> 00:18:23.600 interactively control skeletal<br>
