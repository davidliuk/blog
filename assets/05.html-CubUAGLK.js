Use insights to refine the product and sales pitch.</li><li><strong>Avoid Premature Scaling</strong>: Delay hiring a large sales force until the product and sales process are validated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Transition Phase</strong>: <ul><li><strong>Develop Repeatable Sales Model</strong>: Once early adopters validate the product (e.g., positive ROI from pilots), hire &quot;enlightened reps&quot; to systematize outreach (e.g., telesales for education sector).</li><li><strong>Partner Strategically</strong>: Collaborate with Tandy/RadioShack for distribution, but negotiate terms to retain flexibility (e.g., non-exclusive agreements).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Execution Phase</strong>: <ul><li><strong>Scale with Standardization</strong>: After achieving &quot;traction&quot; (e.g., consistent sales yield), expand sales teams and marketing campaigns (e.g., TV ads targeting mainstream users).</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Key Risks to Mitigate</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Premature Marketing</strong>: Avoid broad campaigns until product reliability is proven (e.g., GRiDPad’s success was partly due to iterative improvements post-launch).</li><li><strong>Overdependency on Tandy</strong>: Secure cross-licensing for GRiD’s &quot;C language&quot; enhancements but diversify partnerships (e.g., explore Sony or HP for hardware manufacturing).</li></ul><hr><h4 id="integration-of-both-frameworks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-of-both-frameworks"><span><strong>Integration of Both Frameworks</strong></span></a></h4><ul><li><strong>Customer Feedback Drives Sales Strategy</strong>: Early adopters’ input informs both product refinements (Innovation Funnel) and sales tactics (e.g., targeting Linux evangelists first, as Scalix did).</li><li><strong>Align Resources with Learning Phases</strong>: Use limited cash reserves to fund iterative development and small-scale pilots rather than overhiring.</li></ul><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: By combining customer-centric design with phased sales scaling, Palm can avoid the fate of Momenta (which burned $55M prematurely) and replicate Clever’s success in transitioning from founder-led sales to scalable growth.</p><hr><p><strong>Final Note</strong>: Hawkins’ ability to balance IP negotiations (with Tandy) and customer-driven agility will determine whether Palm becomes the &quot;iPhone of the 90s&quot; or a cautionary tale.</p><hr><h2 id="stakeholders-objectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stakeholders-objectives"><span>Stakeholders objectives</span></a></h2><p>Which objectives</p><ul><li>are more important (to )</li></ul><p>Negotiation</p><hr><ul><li>How do we turn innovation into products, and products into ventures?</li></ul><p>Chart, is not to calc,</p><p>They teach sales management, but not teach sales.</p><p>Rogers Diffusion of Innovation</p>',145)]))}const g=t(r,[["render",o],["__file","05.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/05.html","title":"05: Innovation SLC","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"05: Innovation SLC We now move on to the product development module.
