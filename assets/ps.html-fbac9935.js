(Up to 300 words)</p><hr><p>I&#39;ve been deeply influenced by the community around me, where there&#39;s a strong belief in the power of education to create a fairer society. Growing up, I saw how much everyone around me valued learning, not just for grades but for making things better for everyone. This has really shaped the way I think about my studies, making me see them as not just about getting ahead personally, but as a way to help bring equal opportunities to all.</p><p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in initiatives aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in higher education. As the Secretary of the Academic Planning Center in the College Student Union, I focused on creating inclusive educational programs for all students in need. I organized online study rooms and lectures and served as an Advanced Mathematics lecturer to help 186 students from 3 grades who were faced with difficulty in course study. Many of them are racial minorities or international students who might face language barriers or have limited access to academic support. I can still feel the great difficulties they faced. I well prepared 12 courses that covered most of the key knowledge points and shared my detailed summary notes online to ensure that all these resources were accessible to them. Fortunately, most of my classmates made progress in the subsequent quizzes. This endeavor reinforced my belief in equitable education for every student, regardless of their cultural or socioeconomic background.</p><p>As I look forward to my graduate studies at Yale, I am keen on contributing to teaching and mentoring programs, where I can use my experiences to support and inspire students from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, I aim to be involved in community outreach programs that work towards increasing awareness and participation in higher education among historically underrepresented communities.</p><hr><p>My academic journey, deeply rooted in my cultural background as a Chinese student, reflects a profound respect for education shaped by a society that values academic rigor. This upbringing has instilled in me a strong work ethic and an appreciation for education&#39;s transformative power. My experiences have not only enriched my perspective but have also heightened my sensitivity to cultural diversity in the educational landscape.</p><hr><p>My academic journey has been significantly shaped by my cultural background and experiences as a Chinese student.
