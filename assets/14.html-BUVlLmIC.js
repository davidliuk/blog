This class builds on our discussion of the Venture Capital Method and shows how the terms proposed and agreed to in venture capital investments serve to protect investors (and occasionally, entrepreneurs) from the uncertainty and risk inherent in hi-tech ventures and investments. The assignment has three parts:</p><ul><li>Required readings/video (plus optional readings that you may find useful)</li><li>VC Negotiation Exercise - Preparation (prepare and submit as an individual <strong>prior to class</strong>)</li><li>VC Negotiation Exercise - In-Class Negotiation (done in teams <strong>in-class</strong>)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIRED READINGS/VIDEO</strong></p><p>Review the article, “<a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/86c8ba52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>You Can Negotiate with Venture Capitalists</strong></a>” (HBR #87207) . The article is rich in content, though the tone is overly adversarial with respect to the investor-entrepreneur relationship.</p><p>As you study this article, think about the following questions:</p><ul><li>The three most important issues when structuring transactions between venture investors and entrepreneurs are generally regarded to be valuation, type of securities (i.e., preference), and control. What should the entrepreneur realistically hope to achieve in each of these elements?</li><li>What additional elements are likely to be included in the structure of a venture financing package? To what extent should the entrepreneur be concerned about these elements?</li><li>What provisions will venture investors likely require with respect to their ability to cash out when they feel the time is appropriate? To what extent, if any, are these of concern to the entrepreneur?</li><li>What are the potential areas of conflict of interest between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists?</li><li>How can you build trust in the relationship between entrepreneurs and venture capitalist?</li></ul><p>To allow more time for our in-class negotiating exercise, I have recorded a 16-min introduction to Negotiations lecture.

We will use this information to conduct our in-class negotiation.</strong></p><p>The in-class, team exercise is intended to reinforce the principles and calculations of venture investing through a negotiation exercise. Prior to the exercise, participants should be familiar with the following concepts:</p><ul><li>Revenue, earnings, runway (for ventures)</li><li>Investment strategy, ROI, returns (for early-stage investors or funds)</li><li>Accelerators</li><li>Pre-Seed, Seed and Series X funding rounds (where X is a designated letter indicating sequence)</li><li>Priced versus unpriced investment deals</li><li>Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) and convertible debt (or convertible note)</li><li>Founders, common, preferred, and participating preferred stock, including liquidation preferences</li><li>Pre-money and post-money valuation</li><li>Discounts and valuation caps</li></ul><p>It may be helpful, but it is not necessary, for participants to understand generative AI (or any other technology mentioned). Instead, focus on the background and plan for the venture as well as the terms of the investment proposal(s).</p><p>This exercise has three different roles: entrepreneur, investor 1, and investor 2.
