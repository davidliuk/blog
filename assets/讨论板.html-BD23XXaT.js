One idea we discussed was how much independence and freedom we should give our children, especially young children. One related issue is whether there should be an age limit on when children can have mobile phones.</p><p>In this discussion post, I would like you to discuss whether you agree or disagree with the idea of setting a minimum age for when children can have a mobile phone. Explain your perspective.</p><p>Andrew:</p><p>I totally agree with the idea of not giving children phones before they reach a certain age, let&#39;s say ten years or so. l believe children younger than ten are not yet ready to deal with the world that comes with mobile phones, as it can put them in harm&#39;s way.</p><p>Claire:</p><p>Honestly, I am against the idea of restricting mobile phone access for young children. I believe mobile phones can help children communicate with their parents if they need their help for an urgent matter when they are away from their parents at school or else where. Maybe companies can invent a special kind of mobile phone that is some how kid friendly.</p><p>范文</p><blockquote><p>177</p></blockquote><p>In my perspective, it is preferable for children to have an age limit on the use of mobile phones because playing phones excessively exerts a negative impact on children’s health.</p><p>For one thing, because of lacking self-control, they are possibly addicted to games. Staring at the screen for a long time harms their eyesight so that they cannot see many things clearly. Besides, keeping sedentary, kids suffer obesity and are prone to other diseases.</p><p>For another, obviously, children are immature so that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Thus, they are easily influenced by negative information on phones like violent content so as to form a false value. When there are conflicts with other peers, children will fight with them.</p><p>Moreover, if kids spend too much time living in a virtual world, they may become unsociable and eccentric losing the ability to socialize in a normal way, which undermines the relationship with their friends.</p><p>Consequently, there is every reason to believe that limiting a minimum age of owing a mobile phone contributes to the health of kids.</p><h3 id="_8-2-家考" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-2-家考"><span>8.2 家考</span></a></h3><p>Doctor</p><p>In the next few weeks, we&#39;ll be talking about urban traffic management. Let&#39;s begin by discussing one popular idea--creating car-free central zones. Some cities around the world have recently designated their downtown areas as being automobile-free which means that vehicles are not allowed to enter the city centers.</p><p>Do you think that more cities should make their central zones car-free? Why and why not?</p><p>Claire:</p><p>I support the idea of establishing car-free central zones because this will result in one important benefit for city residents-it will be better for their health. Instead of driving everywhere, people will be encouraged to walk or cycle more. It would be a great way to incorporate exercise into people&#39;s routines.</p><p>Paul:</p><p>It sounds like a good idea, but I&#39;m skeptical. My main concern is that many businesses located in the city centers, such as shops and restaurants, may suffer because the customers will no longer be able to reach those businesses by car. For some customers, if they cann&#39;t drive, they won&#39;t go at all.</p><p>范文：</p><p>In my perspective, it is preferable promote the relationship with family members and friends by hanging out with them in car-free central zones.</p><p>In my perspective, it is preferable to promote the relationship with family members and friends by spending time with them in car-free central zones.</p><p>To be more specific, currently, individuals are too occupied with their work, and children also spend most of their time in school, so they just have little time to interact with each other. It’s widely acknowledged that deep communication between parents and children is essential for children’s development, since children feel love and acquire life guide when communicating with parents. By hanging out together, children would have time to share their experience in school with parents and ask for advice to solve the problem they face. Parents get to know more about their children so that they can adjust their parenting methods to get along better with children.</p><p>What’s more, shopping downtown with friends is a popular amusement in car-free zones, like pedestrian malls in cities. They are likely to buy clothes, eat delicious food or participate in some entertainment projects.</p><p>Consequently, More interaction and company strengthen the relationship with friends.</p><h3 id="s" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#s"><span>s</span></a></h3><p>Do you believe that governments should provide financial support to artists-for example, painters, sculptors, musicians, or filmmakers? Why or why not?</p><hr><p>In my perspective, it&#39;s more reasonable for the government to invest in providing help for artists, and the reasons of which can be substantiated as follows.</p><p>For one thing, because of the fierce competition in society, people constantly feel the pressure of all kinds of work and tasks, so it is of vital importance for people to have some art exhibition to unwind and release their pressure.</p><p>For another, if the government provide support to artists, artists can make more art pieces for the public, which can significantly improve the circumstance of humanity.</p><p>Consequently, there is every reason to believe that providing support to artists contributes to the harmony of society.</p><p>Nowadays, due to the fierce competition of the society, people encounter more problems and are under excessive pressure from various tasks and responsibilities.</p><p>In my perspective, it is reasonable for governments to financially support artists, and this can be substantiated as follows.</p><p>Firstly, in today&#39;s competitive society, people face immense pressure from various tasks and responsibilities. Therefore, it is vital for individuals to have access to art exhibitions as a means to unwind and alleviate stress. Art provides a much-needed escape and can serve as a source of relaxation and rejuvenation.</p><p>Secondly, government support enables artists to create more art pieces for the public, significantly enhancing the cultural landscape. Art has the power to inspire, challenge societal norms, and foster social cohesion. By investing in artists, governments can facilitate the production of thought-provoking works that promote cultural understanding, creativity, and inclusivity.</p><p>In conclusion, providing financial support to artists contributes to the well-being of individuals and the overall development of society. By recognizing the importance of art, governments can create a harmonious environment that values creativity and cultural enrichment.</p><p>In my perspective, it is not only reasonable but also crucial for the government to invest in providing assistance to artists, and the reasons behind this stance can be substantiated as follows.</p><p>Firstly, in today&#39;s highly competitive society, individuals constantly face immense pressure from various work and responsibilities. Therefore, it becomes vital for people to have access to art exhibitions as a means to unwind and alleviate their stress. By supporting artists, the government can foster an environment where people can engage with art, allowing them to find solace, inspiration, and a way to release their pressure.</p><p>Secondly, when the government provides support to artists, it enables them to create more diverse and meaningful art pieces for the public. Art has the power to transcend boundaries, provoke emotions, and challenge societal norms. By investing in artists, the government plays a pivotal role in enhancing the cultural landscape and enriching humanity as a whole. Art has the potential to ignite conversations, foster empathy, and promote understanding among individuals from different backgrounds, thus contributing to a more harmonious society.</p><p>In conclusion, there is every reason to believe that providing substantial support to artists is not only beneficial but also necessary. It serves as a means to help individuals cope with the pressures of life and cultivates an environment where creativity and cultural expression thrive. By recognizing the significance of art and investing in artists, the government can contribute to the overall well-being and harmony of society.</p><p>Many college students face the overwhelming financial burden of expensive textbooks, which hinders their access to learning materials. In my opinion, a viable solution to this problem is to promote the use of e-books. This approach offers several benefits that can alleviate students&#39; financial strain. Firstly, the internet provides a vast array of books at relatively low prices, enabling students to access a wide range of materials with ease. Additionally, e-books are highly portable, allowing students to carry multiple books in a single device, reducing physical burden and costs. While transitioning to e-books may pose challenges, such as students&#39; preferences for physical textbooks, universities can invest in digital infrastructure and support students in accessing e-books. By embracing digital resources, universities can create a more inclusive and affordable learning environment. In conclusion, promoting the use of e-books is a practical solution that addresses the issue of expensive textbooks and enhances access to educational materials for college students.</p><p>Andrew presents a compelling point that soft skill should not use classroom time.</p><p>After all, classroom time is very precious for students, especially when they have a lot of classes to take.</p><p>Nevertheless, considering the university&#39;s responsibilities in promoting students&#39; all round development, I am inclined to prioritize using classroom time to soft skills.</p><p>In my view, soft skill is of great significance of students&#39; general ability, which can lay a solid foundation for their future career success.</p><p>A soft skill class, taking up classroom time, can araise students&#39; awareness of its importance. However, if the soft skill classes don&#39;t have its&#39; own classroom time, students are more intended to ignore them, owing much to their heavily daily acdemic burden.</p><p>Claire presents a compelling point that high school courses should change.</p><p>After all, being admitted by university is one of the purpose of high school courses.</p><p>Nevertheless, considering the high schools&#39; responsibilities in promoting students&#39; all round development, I am inclined to prioritize the inclusion of innovative subjects in public schools.</p><p>In my view, innovative subjects can enhance students&#39; overall ability.</p><p>Innovative subjects not only provides access to the cutting edge technology, but also offers more insights into what is going on in the rapily developing society.</p><p>For instance, as computer science keeps developing rapidly, professors in our Software Department provide more kinds of AI foundation class, which lay a solid foundation for our future career as an AI researcher.</p><p>Therefore, I firmly believe that innovative subjects</p><p>Claire makes a compelling argument against making changes to high school courses, as one of their purposes is to prepare students for university admission. However, considering the responsibility of high schools in promoting students&#39; all-round development, I am inclined to prioritize the inclusion of innovative subjects in public schools.</p><p>In my opinion, innovative subjects have the potential to enhance students&#39; overall abilities.

There is no denying that online shopping puts significant pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar stores, potentially leading to their closure. However, considering the advancements and efficiency brought about by online shopping, I am inclined to prioritize the creation of new and more advanced job positions.</p><p>In other words, online shopping not only greatly enhances the overall convenience for consumers, allowing them to purchase goods with just a few taps, but also creates job opportunities in areas such as delivery services, software engineering, and data analysis. For instance, influential online commercial giant Jingdong has generated over 440,000 jobs in society and continues to hire over 20,000 people annually, contributing significantly to the thriving job market.</p><p>Therefore, I firmly believe that online shopping has a positive impact on the job market, as it not only transforms traditional roles but also creates new employment opportunities.</p><blockquote><p>brick-and-mortar stores 实体店</p></blockquote><p>I agree that being parents nowadays is more challenging than in the past. Balancing work and family life has become increasingly difficult, as both parents often need to work to support their family. The advent of technology has introduced new complexities, such as monitoring children&#39;s online activities. Additionally, societal pressures for children&#39;s success have intensified. Overall, modern parenting entails more stress and demands. It is important for society to recognize and support parents in their efforts to raise well-rounded children.</p><p>I agree with the statement that it is important to learn about the history of our ancestors. Understanding our roots helps us develop a sense of identity and belonging. By exploring our ancestors&#39; experiences, we gain insights into their struggles, achievements, and cultural heritage. This knowledge can shape our values, traditions, and even career choices. Additionally, studying history allows us to learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. It fosters empathy and tolerance by appreciating the diversity of human experiences. Overall, learning about our ancestors&#39; history not only connects us to our past but also enriches our present and guides our future.</p>',91)]))}const p=t(s,[["render",a],["__file","讨论板.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/test/TOEFL/WRITING/%E7%BB%83%E4%B9%A0/%E8%AE%A8%E8%AE%BA%E6%9D%BF.html","title":"讨论板","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"讨论板 Andrew presents a compelling argument in favor of promoting student sports activities.
