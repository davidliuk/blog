LinkedIn’s Segmentation &amp; Value Proposition</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Relationship Managers (≈90%)</strong>: Want to maintain and reconnect with trusted first-degree contacts for future opportunities, track colleagues’ career moves, and occasionally accept inbound requests (citeturn1file0).</li><li><strong>Networkers (≈5%)</strong>: Constantly grow their networks by adding large numbers of direct connections, including strangers. They frequently act as intermediaries for others’ introduction requests (citeturn1file0).</li><li><strong>Contactors (≈5%)</strong>: Recruiters, salespeople, or business-development professionals who systematically search for new candidates or prospects; rely heavily on the referral mechanism to reach beyond their direct networks (citeturn1file0).</li></ul><p>LinkedIn offers each segment the ability to (a) manage or expand relationships, (b) build trust via endorsements, and (c) find talent, clients, or other professional resources quickly.</p><hr><p><strong>2. Competitive Positioning &amp; Differentiation</strong></p><p>LinkedIn focuses on <strong>professional</strong> rather than purely social networking. It preserves trust and relevance through a <strong>referral-based introduction system</strong> and <strong>detailed professional profiles</strong>. This differs from more socially oriented platforms and from simple “open contact” sites (citeturn1file0). By emphasizing privacy, controlled contacts, and work-related features (e.g., endorsements, job listings), LinkedIn builds credibility among business users.</p><hr><p><strong>3. LinkedIn’s Potential Positioning Statement</strong></p><p><em>&quot;For business professionals seeking quality connections, LinkedIn is the leading online network that uses referral-based introductions and endorsements to ensure trusted, relevant interactions. Unlike purely social sites, LinkedIn keeps a professional focus that helps users expand their careers, recruit talent, and find new business opportunities.&quot;</em> (Adapted from citeturn1file0)</p><hr><p><strong>4. Recommended Strategic Option</strong></p><p>Between (1) rolling out a <strong>premium bundle</strong> of eight services for power users (e.g., more simultaneous requests, “Ask Your Network,” “Who Should I Already Know?”) and (2) allowing <strong>paid direct contact</strong> without referrals, a <strong>premium bundle</strong> seems safer. It aligns with <strong>segment-based pricing</strong>—charging those who derive higher value (citeturn1file1)—and avoids alienating relationship managers who prefer not to receive unsolicited messages. This premium approach could generate enough revenue from frequent users (networkers, active contactors) without disturbing the referral culture valued by relationship managers.</p><hr><p><strong>5. Segments Served vs. Potentially Alienated</strong></p><ul><li>Premium Bundle <ul><li>Primarily serves networkers and high-usage contactors (they want advanced tools).</li><li>Relationship managers remain free-tier users and likely stay engaged.</li></ul></li><li>Paid Direct Contact <ul><li>Favored by recruiters/sales (contactors) who need frictionless outreach.</li><li>Risks alienating relationship managers who may resent unsolicited messages (citeturn1file0).</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong>6. Which Option Each Segment Prefers</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Relationship Managers</strong>: Prefer to keep introductions through referrals (i.e., free tier and minimal spam), so they’d lean toward the <strong>premium bundle</strong> option if it preserves existing boundaries.</li><li><strong>Networkers &amp; Contactors</strong>: May welcome either option but would especially benefit from direct outreach. However, networkers also appreciate the referral system that preserves their “intermediary” role (citeturn1file0).</li></ul><hr><p><strong>7. Revenue Drivers</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Premium Bundle</strong>: Recurring subscription fees from power users who value extended features. Could also deepen usage of job listings and other verticals (citeturn1file0).</li><li><strong>Paid Direct Contact</strong>: Transaction fees for each unsolicited message—especially appealing for recruiters who consistently need new leads (citeturn1file0).</li></ul><hr><p><strong>8. Impact on Revenue &amp; User Growth</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Premium Bundle</strong>: <ul><li>Generates steady subscription revenue from frequent users.</li><li>Minimally disrupts casual members (relationship managers), thus preserving overall user growth.</li><li>Consistent with <strong>value-based pricing</strong> (charge power users more) (citeturn1file1).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Paid Direct Contact</strong>: <ul><li>Could generate high transactional revenue if many recruiters pay-per-message.</li><li>Might drive away or discourage relationship managers, reducing long-term network growth and undermining trust (citeturn1file0).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, a premium subscription approach appears more sustainable, preserving trust while capturing extra value from segments that rely heavily on LinkedIn’s advanced features (citeturn1file0; citeturn1file1).</p>',48)]))}const d=o(a,[["render",l],["__file","09.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/09.html","title":"09: Marketing, LinkedIn","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"09: Marketing, LinkedIn Review “Note on Marketing Strategy” (HBS 9-598-061) Read the article, “Principles of Pricing”.
