Being willing to accept others suggestions exposes us to various kinds of opinions, thus enabling us to keep our mind updated.</p><p>What&#39;s more, we can learn more about a certain field from other ideas, thus having a deeper and comprehensive understanding of it. Consequently, we will be more competitive equipped with others&#39;fresh ideas and are more likely to succeed in the future.</p><p>Here comes a concrete example. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, used to be an English teacher and was not quite proficient in technologies. However, he is willing to accept advice and theories from his staff, and therefore he achieves success and becomes one of the wealthiest people in the world.</p><p>So it is essential to be open to new ideas so that we can compensate for our drawbacks and be more comprehensive.</p><hr><p>In addition, being open to new ideas and being willing to change his or her own mind is conducive to expanding people&#39;s social networks.</p><p>Compared with people who are stubborn, people of this kind will leave a favorable impression on others, and hence they can have more harmonious relationship with others. They will be classified as the easy-going and coworkers will be more willing to communicate with them. In this circumstance, they can exchange ideas and learn from each other in a free atmosphere.</p><p>What&#39;s more, they will be provided with more opportunities because of the pleasant impression they leave on others. When doing business, others will consider them as a perfect partner because of their open and flexible mind. During cooperation, less conflicts will occur, and they can achieve a win-win situation.</p><p>So a person&#39;s open mind to new ideas is crucial in dealing interpersonal relationships, and may even bring them extra benefits. With this, it is more possible for them to succeed.</p><h2 id="教育类" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#教育类"><span>教育类</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-不要当学霸" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-不要当学霸"><span>1. 不要当学霸</span></a></h3><p>To start with, learning one subject allows students to enhance their study efficiency.</p><p>For one thing, it is widely acknowledged that the time for students&#39;learning is precious due to excessive assignments. Obviously, learning one course provides students with more time to focus on their specialized course better, which leads to excellent academic performance. In contrast, taking various classes will occupy most of students&#39; time previewing and reviewing their specialty courses. Under this circumstance, students are more likely to feel exhausted and have little time to complete their assignments in a high quality, which exerts a negative impact on their study efficiency. As a result, they fail to consolidate knowledge they have learned and achieve high grades during final exams.</p><p>For another, various subjects, such as some elective courses, have no relation with their major. Being compelled to participate in these classes, students will lose interest in a short period of time. Sleeping in the classes, and chatting with other classmates are not surprising.</p><p>Obviously, if students take various classes, their study efficiency will be reduced, and they lose competitive edges when hunting jobs.</p><hr><p>In addition, specializing in only one subject, students are able to participate in extracurricular activities, which constitutes a stepping stone to improving practical skills.</p><p>For one thing, doing physical activities, instead of enrolling in many classes, is essential for students. For instance, via joining a basketball team, students are equipped with teamwork ability, which is an indispensable part of their career development.</p><p>What&#39;s more, perseverance and diligence can be learned from a fierce basketball competition, In order to win, students have to spare no effort and never give up even if they are tired. During the process of exercising, students possess a robust body, which lays a solid foundation for their busy learning.</p><p>For another, if students take only one course, they would have enough time to travel. During a journey, not only could students have a deeper understanding of different culture and history, which broadens their horizons, but also they can encounter different people, and hone their communication skills through interacting deeply.</p><h3 id="_2-旅游-开拓视野" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-旅游-开拓视野"><span>2. 旅游-开拓视野</span></a></h3><p>By virtue of travel, we are capable of broadening our horizons.</p><p>To be more specific, we have a thorough understanding of various history and culture in tourist attractions. Actually, only after stepping on tourist attractions in person can one fully immerse himself in its real cultural surroundings that cannot be read from books.</p><p>For example, visiting the Statue of Liberty in the USA, we are likely to know American&#39;s love and desire of freedom. Also, we have access to different ways of thinking through communicating with local residents from different backgrounds.</p><p>What&#39;s more, we taste delicious food around the world so as to learn distinctive customs and habits. For instance, plenty of foreigners use knife and fork instead of chopsticks to have dinner. These life experiences brought by traveling would become a part of wealth constituting a stepping stone to the future career.</p><p>Consequently, it is worthwhile to travel rather than deposit the money.</p><h3 id="_3-放松" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-放松"><span>3. 放松</span></a></h3><p>Traveling is beneficial to relax physically and mentally.</p><p>Obviously, due to fierce competition in modern society, citizens usually overwork frequently and keep sedentary in the office for a long time, which means they always feel uncomfortable and tired. Therefore, traveling gives them a chance to relax their body by walking out of their office, stretching out their arms and legs and relaxing their muscles.</p><p>Besides, modern people are always under great pressure from work and life, which renders them stressful. Evidently, traveling with friends or family members is a wise means for them to relieve mental stress. Experiencing beautiful scenery and sharing their worries together are conducive to forgetting troubles and cheering up. As a result, there is every reason to believe that with the aid of traveling, people feel relaxed and refreshed, contributing to health, which is the prerequisite of everything so that the benefits of traveling outweigh those of saving money.</p><h3 id="_4-一起学学习效率高" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-一起学学习效率高"><span>4. 一起学学习效率高</span></a></h3><p>To begin with, by working together students are more motivated forming a constructive study atmosphere.</p><p>There is no denying that students will encounter various difficulties in studying, which renders them depressed and even deprives confidence in their formative years. Under this circumstance, it is group members who encourage each other to move on in the wake of difficulties.</p><p>Besides, with the prevalence of electronic products such as Switch and Xbox, many children are addicted to them owing to the lack of self-discipline. They tend to lose interest in studying and thus decrease their study efficiency. However, group members urge them to pay attention to what teachers talk about and finish assignments with high-quality.</p><p>Hence, there is every reason to believe that learning together contributes to students insisting on study easily.</p><hr><p>Meanwhile, working together is beneficial for children to master more solid knowledge and skills.</p><p>Obviously, there always exist some difficult points in textbooks. If a student tries to understand them merely on his own, he may waste the whole day and it still does not pay off. In contrast, work group enables each one to share relevant information they have got from different sources and their personal perspective. With the aid of those above, they likely catch the essentials easily.</p><p>Moreover, group discussion also offers a chance to share different learning methods and weigh advantages and disadvantages of them. In this case, they can adjust their original studying methods and grasp more solid knowledge instead of learning them by rote.</p><p>Besides, learning together is conducive to fostering communicative skill and teamwork, which constitute a stepping stone to their future development.</p><h3 id="_5-交朋友" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-交朋友"><span>5. 交朋友</span></a></h3><p>Experiencing activities is beneficial for young adults to expand their social networks.</p><p>Obviously, by means of these activities, juveniles get acquainted with more peers who share similar interest comparing with just an activity. With deep communication and interaction, they may become friends and conduct a harmonious relationship. Therefore, it is possible for them to keep in touch with each other in the daily life and even entertain together to enjoy their life. Spending joyful time together with those who have common interest would help get rid of loneliness and cope with daily pressure.</p><p>Moreover, individuals excel in different fields like subjects or methods of study, thus learning strengths from others to make up for their weaknesses and solve a variety of problems in study or future work. As a result, excellent interpersonal relationships pave the way for young students to achieve greater accomplishments</p><h3 id="_6-不玩电子产品" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-不玩电子产品"><span>6. 不玩电子产品</span></a></h3><p>Watching movies and television excessively exerts a negative influence on youngsters&#39; health.</p><p>For one thing, because of lacking self-control, they are possibly addicted to television shows, like cartoons. Staring at the screen for a long time harms their eyesight. Besides, keeping sedentary, kids suffer obesity and are prone to other diseases, leading to poor performance further.</p><p>For another, obviously, young adults are immature so that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Thus, they are easily influenced by negative information on television like violent and obscene content so as to form a false value. When there are conflicts with other peers, juveniles will fight with them.</p><p>Moreover, if they spend too much time living in a virtual world, they may become unsociable and eccentric losing the ability to socialize in a normal way, which undermines the relationship with their friends.</p><p>Consequently, there is every reason to believe that movies and television contributes to health problems of juveniles.</p><hr><p>Indulging in computer games gives rise to the decrease of study efficiency for kids.</p><p>Having a glimpse of the current situation in education, we may marvel at plenty of subjects and homework students must deal with every day, Thus, children ought to devote enough time to previewing in order to have a thorough understanding of difficult points, as well as reviewing and finishing assignments with the purpose of consolidating knowledge. If they waste most of time to play a computer, they have no time to acquire solid knowledge.</p><p>What&#39;s more, without self-discipline, they often stay up late to accomplish the mission in game. As a sleep-deprived person, they are less likely to focus on what teachers talk about because they will fall asleep in class, not to mention mastering class content. Meanwhile, being obsessed with various computer games turns students off subjects in their formative years.</p><p>Consequently, there is every reason to believe that giving a computer likely contributes to reducing study efficiency.</p><h3 id="_7-新颗的教学方法" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-新颗的教学方法"><span>7. 新颗的教学方法</span></a></h3><p>To begin with, encouraging students to exchange ideas in class contributes to attracting their attention.</p><p>Supposing that a teacher concentrates on lecturing, thus lacking the interaction with students, it is easier for students to feel bored and dull and lose study interest. Hence, they are likely to fall asleep or chat with other classmates in the classroom. In contrast, exchanging ideas among students is a great teaching method to improve their study enthusiasm. Obviously, discussion draws pupils&#39; attention so that they would participate in it actively, including listening carefully and thinking positively, which creates a constructive learning atmosphere in class.</p><p>Furthermore, it gives teachers more inspiration when they receive students&#39;feedback in class. In this way, teachers make some adjustments in time in order to enhance the quality of teaching. Consequently, there is every reason to believe that discussion renders pupils more motivated and engaged in the class.</p><p>What&#39;s more, discussing and exchanging ideas are really imperative for students in order to master more solid knowledge and skills.</p><p>For one thing, when students discuss difficult questions and exchange their ideas with each other, they start to consider from different perspectives. Only in this way can these students cope with and comprehend difficult points in study more effectively. Besides, it encourages them to take the initiative to study instead of just accepting teachers&#39;opinions. By comparison, provided that students just take notes, they will be reluctant to analyze and solve problems by themselves gradually.</p><p>For another, discussion is conducive to enhancing students&#39;teamwork so that they learn how to communicate and cooperate with others, which paves the way for their further development. As a result, it is due to discussion that they could have a command of more knowledge and skills.</p><h3 id="_8-知识和价值观" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-知识和价值观"><span>8. 知识和价值观</span></a></h3><p>To begin with, professors are of great importance for passing on solid knowledge to students.</p><p>To be more specific, they may have unique teaching styles, which will greatly boost students&#39;learning enthusiasm. In this circumstance, students are more willing to spend time in studying and searching for various kinds of information related to their favorite subjects, hence having a deep and comprehensive understanding of knowledge.</p><p>Additionally, experienced professors teach students in a more systematic way and know where key points are, thus enhancing students&#39;study efficiency and contributing to mastering their professional knowledge.</p><p>What&#39;s more, professors can teach students more than just knowledge acquired from books. They may teach them practical experience, which is valuable and cannot be gained by students&#39; self-education. Consequently, students will be at an advantage when hunting for jobs in the job market and are more likely to acquire satisfying jobs.</p><p>Thus, there is every reason to believe that professors are a crucial part in imparting knowledge to students.</p><hr><p>In addition, professors are capable of teaching students right values.</p><p>This is because students are in growth, and they haven&#39;t established a mature value system. They tend to imitate virtues from a professor as they consider him as a role model. So professors are supposed to aid students in forming right values.</p><p>Specifically, students should be polite so that they can leave a more favorable impression on others in this way and have better relationships with others. So next time when they encounter some problems and need some help, other people will be willing to reach out their hands. Apart from that, when some opportunities appear, other people may consider giving the opportunities to someone polite.</p><p>Furthermore, students ought to be diligent in their study instead of indulging in various computer games like King of Glory because the addiction to such games will occupy a lot of time. As a result, they cannot spare enough time on study and get low grades.</p><p>What&#39;s more, there is excessive violence in computer games. If students cannot distinguish reality from games, they even easily commit crimes. There are many other values like these, so we can see that professors are essential because they can teach students right values.</p><h3 id="_9-老师和设备" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-老师和设备"><span>9. 老师和设备</span></a></h3><p>To start with, enhancing teachers&#39;quality is of top priority.</p><p>For children, their teachers are only authorities, which means teachers are key factors that can improve students scores. If teachers possess excellent abilities, they are more likely to help their students achieve dreams in the future. Schools ought to ask teachers to learn from theoretical courses on the Internet. Especially, it is convenient for them to study online theoretical courses due to the popularity of computers. They will learn famous professors&#39; educational methods by studying online courses.</p><p>What&#39;s more, schools also hold teaching competitions, which allows young teachers to compete with each other and promote with each other. After it, most of young teachers will learn from strengths of others and make up for their weaknesses. As a result, modern educational system pays more attention to quality-oriented education instead of exam-oriented education, so teachers are supposed to learn knowledge about modern education accordingly.</p><hr><p>In addition, upgrading school facilities also plays a significant role in improving quality of education.</p><p>With the development of technology, there are a great number of ways to enhance the quality of education.</p><p>For one thing, an increasing number of teachers start to utilize multimedia such as PowerPoint. These modern devices enable their students to participate in and focus on classes attentively, since these ways are capable of attracting attention from students. Accordingly, this is a great way to enhance their efficiency.</p><p>For another, some laboratories are worth establishing due to their functions that are beneficial for students to comprehend theoretical knowledge. The problem today is that students cannot make full use of their theoretical knowledge in the reality. Therefore, laboratories provide them with opportunities so that they put theoretical knowledge into practice, which allows them to better adapt to the modern society and own all-round development.</p><p>Moreover, students gradually find themselves stuck with a lot of homework and hardly have places and facilities to do sports, so sports equipment is conducive to their exercise even if they can only exercise for a short time. This is a favorable method that makes students feel refreshed and keep physically healthy so that they can absorb more knowledge at the same time.</p><p>Consequently, these facilities contribute to the ability that quickly blends to modern society and hunts a decent job.</p><h2 id="三、社会生活类" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#三、社会生活类"><span>三、社会生活类</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-个人和关系" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-个人和关系"><span>1. 个人和关系</span></a></h3><p>Initially, doing housework enables children to foster independence in life.</p><p>With the rising of living standard, more and more people have the opportunity to study and work in big cities, which are far away from the hometown to achieve their value and dream.</p><p>Therefore, it&#39;s imperative for children to learn basic life skills to live alone without their parents&#39; care. Doing household chores is an excellent way for them to learning practical skills. Learning cooking allows children to make their own dishes at their apartment in the future to save money.</p><p>In addition, by doing cleaning work, children have the ability to render their life environment more comfortable since a neat apartment contributes to a good mood and high efficiency in studying. Thus, there is every reason to believe that children obtain many vital practical skills by doing housework.</p><hr><p>Additionally, doing housework contributes to promoting family relationship in a long run.</p><p>To be more specific, currently, parents are too occupied with their work, and children also spend most of their time in school, so they just have little time to interact with each other. It&#39;s widely acknowledged that communication between parents and children is essential for children&#39;s development, since children feel love and acquire life guide when communicating with parents. By doing housework together, children would have time to share their experience in school with parents and ask for advice to solve the problem they face. Parents get to know more about their children so that they can adjust their education methods to get along better with children.</p><p>What&#39;s more, children learn the sense of responsibility, since they realize that parents devote wholeheartedly to the family by not only working hard to earn enough money but also doing housework after one day&#39;s travail. At the same time, parents will also be delighted when seeing their children cleaning the house. As a result, the relationship between parents and children is enhanced a lot.</p><h3 id="_2-生活和工作-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-生活和工作-1"><span>2. 生活和工作 1</span></a></h3><p>Initially, owing to the development of technology and transportation, living in developed cities is beneficial to improve life quality.</p><p>To be more specific, advanced infrastructures are available in cities that provide various ways for people to relax themselves. Shopping malls enable citizens to purchase basic necessities at economical prices, satisfying their needs at best.</p><p>Meanwhile, entertainment facilities offer them suitable places to enlarge social circle and boost relationship with their old friends. Secondly, due to the fierce competition of society, students attach greater importance to their education in order to discover their potential. Large cities are able to recruit excellent professors using student-oriented teaching methods that not only elevate students&#39;academic performance but also give them opportunities to put knowledge into practice.</p><p>Thirdly, as parents are getting older and are prone to diseases, people who move to cities tend to be easier to enjoy advanced health care.</p><p>To conclude, living outside hometown benefits a lot from every aspect of life.</p><hr><p>In addition, living in cities is more possible for people to hunt a decent and suitable job with higher salaries that are irreplaceable factors to happiness and success.</p><p>Thanks to convenient transportation and developed economy outside, a wide arrange of companies emerge, providing more job opportunities that are not available in small towns.</p><p>For one thing, large state-owned enterprises and financial companies hire more individuals from all walks of life. Meanwhile, social insurance and policies are ensured to offer ampler pay and more welfare benefits.</p><p>For another, some specific and special trend of social division of labor can only be found in large cities so that every kind of major can find its job correspondingly. Take my friend Amy as an example. She majored in interpreting in college and wanted to find a job as a simultaneous interpreter. Thanks to the highly advanced world trade, this kind of job is only provided by certain foreign trade companies in coastal cities. As a result, she moved to Shanghai to chase her goal.</p><h3 id="_3-生活和工作-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-生活和工作-2"><span>3. 生活和工作 2</span></a></h3><p>To begin with, managing time better contributes to high work efficiency boosting success. Exposed to a large amount of work, people in current society are likely to procrastinate, which leads to a huge work pressure and a bad temper. To solve this common problem, it&#39;s imperative for people to enhance their ability to manage time. For example, making a to-do-list enables people to have a concrete plan so as to deal with various tasks step by step and are not easily diverted. Thus, with a proper time schedule, they finish work efficiently and even they would have more time to improve themselves in work becoming more competitive and achieving professional success. Also, people who always cope with more work with high quality definitely achieve the recognition from their bosses and colleagues so that it is possible for them to obtain more precious opportunities and cooperation respectively. Hence, they are more probably to be successful in the long run.</p><hr><p>In addition, by managing time better individuals enrich their lives in many aspects. Nowadays, people are bothered by plenty of daily chores, which render their life so boring and exhausted. However, having a proper time management is beneficial for them to enjoy life. For one thing, it would provide opportunities to promote relationship with families and friends. For example, people would have more time to travel with families. Not only can they enjoy their time with beloved ones but also experience new lifestyles and broaden their horizons. For another, with appropriate time management, people make full use of their time to learn new things. For instance, if one manages time better, he may have more time to master a sports skill and read books so as to have a healthy body and a fresh mind, which constitutes a stepping stone to future development. Thus, but for the ability of managing time, people would not be capable of living fully and colorfully.</p><h2 id="四、政府类" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#四、政府类"><span>四、政府类</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-个人和城市" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-个人和城市"><span>1. 个人和城市</span></a></h3><p>Initially, a shopping mall provides more convenience for citizens living in the community.</p><p>Nowadays, with the purpose of acquiring more salary and higher positions, people often overwork under high pressure and live a fast-paced life. Evidently, a shopping mall is a leading choice to benefit people by enriching their daily life. Economical goods in the shopping mall can satisfy the basic needs of local people at best so that a performing art center and a hotel cannot live up to.</p><p>Besides, people gradually realize the importance of maintaining friendship, for an expanded social network is the prerequisite for future success. A shopping mall serves as a place that allows people to reconnect and socialize with their friends, as it provides people a comfortable and harmonious atmosphere to hold a gathering of friends such as restaurants and bars.</p><p>Moreover, it is also a good place to boost relationship with parents. Fortunately, with cinemas, a shopping mall builds a bridge for people to fill the generation gap while watching movies with their parents.</p><p>To conclude, a shopping mall plays an important role not only in entertainment but also in every aspect of people&#39;s daily life.</p><hr><p>Additionally, building a shopping mall in the community stimulates the economy of the region. There is every reason to believe that as the foundation of the society, economy is of top priority of all fields.</p><p>For one thing, due to the fierce competition in modern society, some people usually encounter obstacles about hunting a decent job It is widely acknowledged that a shopping mall renders various opportunities of employment for citizens. Once a shopping mall is set up successfully, a large number of stores and franchises will provide a great deal of employee such as waiters, sell-conductors and cleaners. In contrast, a performing art center and a hotel is mainly sightseeing and relaxing-oriented respectively, which plays a weaker role in rendering so many different types of jobs.</p><p>For another, having a glimpse of the current situation in people&#39;s life standard, it is obvious to find that people now own enough money and are eager to enjoy happiness brought by consuming. After a tight schedule of work, people prefer to buy necessities at an integrated mall closer to their home, for they can save time and energy to have a rest as quickly as possible. However, the former two places are not able to possess such functions.</p><p>What&#39;s more, they often require people to spare more time and unneeded money that is not rational and wise for daily life Consequently, building a shopping mall is more essential than the other two.</p><h3 id="_2-社会问题" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-社会问题"><span>2. 社会问题</span></a></h3><p>The government enacts new policies to improve employment, which exerts an irreplaceable influence on modern society.</p><p>Nowadays in China, college students face the grim reality that they would meet fierce competition when they hunt a job after graduation. Although they would make the most of a variety of opportunities and resources to enrich themselves, there are not enough posts to meet so many graduates. Thus, political leaders adopt various measures to improve the situation.</p><p>For one thing, our political leaders make some policies to encourage government departments and companies to recruit fresh graduates. For another, graduates are offered a variety of opportunities and funds by the government in order to motivate them to start up a business, which benefits them to put what they have learned in the college into practice.</p><p>Therefore, there is every reason to believe that only with the aid of the government could employment problems be solved finally.</p><hr><p>The government bears social responsibility so that it is obliged to protect the environment when people suffer from environmental problems.</p><p>Taking a glimpse of current situation, extensive construction in urban and rural areas eventually undermines eco-system.</p><p>For one thing, exhaust gas emitted by factories and private cars intensifies haze in large cities. As a result, citizens are more likely to have respiratory diseases such as cough and pneumonia.</p><p>For another, waste water pollutes water provided for agriculture so that the land would lose fertility and chemical elements would do harm to the growing of certain crops. Efficient policies can be launched such as restrictions of traffic and limitations towards industrial emission in order to improve living surroundings.</p><p>Moreover, the spiritual support from government is also essential that political leaders make no efforts to call on social consciousness of environment protection and take proper steps to spur the whole nation to make concerted efforts to overcome obstacles. The force from an individual or a small group of people may be tiny, but strength from the collective led by the government can be enormous.</p><hr><p>The government contributes to popularizing and ensuring health care, which is one of the basic social welfare that can&#39;t be relied on individuals.</p><p>Having a glimpse of current circumstances, a large number of people are having difficulties to receive timely and efficient medical health care.</p><p>For one thing, market-oriented reform increases the price of certain medicines and advanced technology devices require higher expenses. Thus, the government takes methods to expand health care coverage by establishing social medical insurance that can be afforded by a vast majority of people.</p><p>Moreover, people are able to enjoy free preventive care and get free checkups annually. Seniors get special discounts on their prescriptions.</p><p>For another, it is always inconvenient for people to find an adjacent hospital that still has empty beds in emergencies. To solve this problem, the government spares no effort to build community hospitals especially in rural areas and recruit elites who have not only received excellent education but also gained sufficient clinical experience.</p><p>Consequently, it&#39;s widely acknowledged that the help from the government should always be the prior source to seek for.</p><hr><p>The government is capable of ensuring social stability and security, generating a harmonious society.</p><p>Obviously, every country is likely to encounter various problems like economic crisis and natural disaster, which probably leads to social turbulence. Hence, the government not only adopts proper means to deal with them, but also guides citizens to move forward by means of their words and behaviors in order to get through the unpleasant period of time.</p><p>For example, all of us might still have memories of Wenchuan earthquake in China in 2008. Soon after the earthquake, premier Wen Jiabao not only came to the spot to comfort the local people, but also gave a public speech on television demonstrating that the government would take proper steps to deal with the emergency circumstances, which spurs the whole nation to make concerted efforts to overcome difficulties.</p><h2 id="五、环保类" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#五、环保类"><span>五、环保类</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-健康" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-健康"><span>1. 健康</span></a></h3><p>Using clean energy contributes to ensuring health.</p><p>A healthy environment is the prerequisite of further development. Without making every effort to protect it, there exists the possibility that the quality of life would drop immensely. If political leaders cannot enact efficient policies such as limitations towards industrial emission, living surroundings will get increasingly harmful.</p><p>For one thing, exhaust gas emitted by factories and private cars intensifies haze in large cities. As a result, citizens are more likely to have respiratory diseases such as cough and pneumonia.</p><p>For another, waste water makes condition worse as it pollutes drinking water.</p><p>What&#39;more, it exposes potential dangerous conditions in which the land would lose fertility and chemical elements would destabilize the eco-system.</p><p>There is every reason to believe that both people and eco-system benefit from using clean energy.</p><h3 id="_2-使用新能源" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-使用新能源"><span>2. 使用新能源</span></a></h3><p>Unprecedented air pollution problems demand attention from the government to encourage companies to use clean energy. Taking a glimpse of the cause of air pollution, industrial emission is to blame. Exhaust gas emitted by factories intensifies haze in large cities especially in winter, leading to the circumstance that citizens are more likely to have respiratory diseases such as cough and pneumonia. For one thing, the government ought to fine illegal gas emission behaviors directly. For another, the government is obliged to render financial support to science-oriented companies in order to helpthem develop more eco-friendly products. For instance, Tesla, a company manufacturing electric cars, enjoys preference policies by local government that enable them to better meet the standard of green technology. Therefore, the use of clean energy is beneficial to solve air pollution fundamentally.</p><h3 id="_3-提高环保意识微信" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-提高环保意识微信"><span>3. 提高环保意识微信</span></a></h3><p>It is also imperative for the government to enhance general consciousness of protecting environment. As the air pollution issue is directly associated with people&#39;s daily life, the government ought to encourage them to keep a close watch on it. The government should demand mass media to place public service advertising on newspapers or television programs so as to leave a profound impression on the public. There&#39;s no denying that mass media bear tremendous social responsibility of educating people. Moreover, individuals from all walks of life can also be encouraged to make concerted efforts to protect the air condition. The government is supposed to advocate low-carbon life and encourage people to take public transit including subway and bus more frequently in order to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide and other air pollutants. What&#39;s more, the government also endeavor to motivate citizens to purchase green products.

To be more specific, nowadays people are under too much pressure from many aspects and just have little time to relax and enjoy. With the inventions of family machines, people are able to relieve themselves from many household chores and therefore have more time to do what they want. For example, dishes washing machines and sweeping machines are commonly used in most of the families. Therefore, people don&#39;t need to deal with such chores after long-time work. Moreover, people can make reservations of popular restaurants on their website so as to get dishes at home or save time of waiting in line. Furthermore, with online shops, it&#39;s possible to make purchase and wait for the delivery of the products just at home. Accordingly, but for the new technology, by no means can people live with such convenience.</p><h2 id="七、工作类" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#七、工作类"><span>七、工作类</span></a></h2><h3 id="_1-物质和精神" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-物质和精神"><span>1. 物质和精神</span></a></h3><p>To start with, high salaries are beneficial for people to improve their life quality.
