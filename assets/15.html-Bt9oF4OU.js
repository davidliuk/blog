We will focus our attention on the standard principles of initial public offerings rather than the exceptions (i.e., dual-class stock, direct offerings, SPACs, etc.) that have received a disproportionate amount of attention. As with venture capital, IPO&#39;s have a lot of associated jargon, making our focus on the basics of standard, <strong>book-building</strong>, IPO&#39;s even more critical.</p><p>Read &quot;<a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/8ea05645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Note on the Initial Public Offering Process</strong></em></a>&quot;.

What criteria should be considered when selecting an underwriter?</li><li>To what extent, if any, are the company’s and the underwriter’s incentives aligned when it comes to pricing the offering?

What is its comparative advantage relative to other social networking companies?</li><li>Why is Facebook going public? What is the planned use of proceeds from the offering?</li><li>What was going on in the U.S. IPO markets prior to Facebook’s offering? What has been the performance of recent IPOs?</li><li>What is the intrinsic value of a Facebook share?

Internal and External Factors Affecting the IPO Decision</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Internal</strong>: Need for substantial capital to fund expansion, early investors’ desire for liquidity, the company’s readiness for public scrutiny (organizational maturity, stable financials), and potential benefits from being a public firm (e.g., reputation, recruiting).</li><li><strong>External</strong>: Market sentiment (favorable or bearish), overall economic conditions (e.g., a financial crisis), industry trends, and the availability of private financing alternatives.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>2. Role of the Underwriter &amp; Criteria for Selection</strong> (investor banker)</p><ul><li>Role of the Underwriter: <ul><li>Conducts <strong>due diligence</strong>, prepares offering documents.</li><li><strong>Markets</strong> the shares via book-building and roadshows.</li><li><strong>Sets the final offer price</strong> and share <strong>allocation</strong>.</li><li>Provides <strong>price stabilization</strong> and aftermarket <strong>support</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>Selection Criteria: <ul><li><strong>Reputation</strong> and <strong>track record</strong> in similar IPOs.</li><li>Strength of <strong>research analyst</strong> coverage in the firm’s <strong>industry</strong>.</li><li><strong>Ability to distribute shares</strong> to institutional and retail investors.</li><li><strong>Underwriting fees</strong> and additional services (e.g., follow-on offering support).</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong>3. Alignment of Incentives &amp; Underwriter Influence on Pricing</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Both the company and underwriter want a successful IPO with healthy demand. A “pop” (rise on day one) is often seen as success.</li><li><strong>Potential Tensions</strong>: <ul><li>Companies may want a higher price to maximize proceeds,</li><li>while underwriters aim to set a price that investors will accept (sometimes leaving “money on the table”).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Influence</strong>: Underwriters typically lead the <strong>book-building</strong> process; they gauge market demand and <strong>guide the final offering price</strong>. Their institutional client relationships can affect how aggressively the price is set.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>4. How Facebook Makes Money, Value Drivers &amp; Comparative Advantage</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Revenue Streams</strong>: <ul><li>Primarily advertising (targeting users based on demographic and activity data);</li><li>secondary revenue from virtual goods and payments (e.g., social gaming).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Value Drivers</strong>: Enormous global <strong>user base</strong>, high engagement, and <strong>rich data for targeted ads</strong>.</li><li><strong>Comparative Advantage</strong>: Strong network effects, brand recognition, and the “social graph” that competitors found hard to replicate.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>5. Why Facebook Went Public &amp; Use of Proceeds</strong></p><ul><li>Reasons: <ul><li>Provide liquidity for early investors (venture capitalists, employees).</li><li>Raise capital to fund ongoing growth (e.g., data centers, acquisitions).</li><li>Gain public share currency for future strategic moves.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Proceeds</strong>: <ul><li>Planned for general corporate purposes, expansion,</li><li>possibly more acquisitions (like Instagram).</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong>6. U.S. IPO Markets Before Facebook’s Offering &amp; Recent Performance</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Market Context</strong>: <ul><li><strong>Recovering</strong> from the <strong>2007–09 financial crisis</strong>, but still <strong>volatile</strong>.</li><li>Mixed investor sentiment and concerns over global economic slowdowns.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Recent Tech IPOs</strong>: LinkedIn (large first-day pop), Groupon (initial jump but later decline), Zynga (price dropped shortly after listing). Investor appetite for high-growth tech was strong, yet valuations were volatile.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>7. Facebook’s Intrinsic Value vs. Underwriters’ Price Talk</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Intrinsic Value</strong>: Some analysts’ DCF models suggested valuations in the $70–80+ billion range depending on growth assumptions.</li><li><strong>Price Talk</strong>: Underwriters raised it from the mid-$20s–$30s up to $34–$38, which implied a valuation over $100 billion. This was seen as aggressive, relying on very high future growth.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>8. Concerns for Potential Shareholders</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Growth &amp; Monetization</strong>: Slowing ad growth, especially on mobile.</li><li><strong>Dual-Class Stock</strong>: Founder Mark Zuckerberg retained significant control with Class B shares.</li><li><strong>Insider Selling &amp; Lock-Up Expirations</strong>: Large share sales by early investors; lock-up periods could flood the market with shares later.</li><li><strong>Valuation Risk</strong>: High price multiples left little margin for error if growth disappointed.</li></ul>',43)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",a],["__file","15.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/15.html","title":"15: IPO, Facebook","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"15: IPO, Facebook If you encounter unfamiliar terms when reading the financial aspects of our case studies and related articles, there are useful glossaries of related terminolo...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://davidliuk.github.io/blog/blog/education/ms/5450/15.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"David's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"15: IPO, Facebook"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"15: IPO, Facebook If you encounter unfamiliar terms when reading the financial aspects of our case studies and related articles, there are useful glossaries of related terminolo..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-05-28T16:32:52.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-05-28T16:32:52.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"15: IPO, Facebook\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-05-28T16:32:52.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"David Liu\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/davidliuk\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1748449972000,"updatedTime":1748449972000,"contributors":[{"name":"David","email":"l729641074@163.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":4.46,"words":1338},"filePathRelative":"education/ms/5450/15.md","localizedDate":"May 28, 2025","excerpt":"\\n<p><em><strong>If you encounter unfamiliar terms when reading the financial aspects of our case studies and related articles, there are useful glossaries of related terminology available at <a href=\\"http://www.investopedia.com/dictionary/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">http://www.investopedia.com/dictionary/</a> and <a href=\\"https://pitchbook.com/blog/private-equity-and-venture-capital-glossary\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://pitchbook.com/blog/private-equity-and-venture-capital-glossary</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.cooleygo.com/glossary/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://www.cooleygo.com/glossary/</a>.</strong></em></p>","autoDesc":true}`);export{d as comp,g as data};
