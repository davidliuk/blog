Educational, Personal, Cultural, Economic, or Social Experiences Shaping My Academic Journey</strong></p><p>My academic journey has been significantly shaped by my cultural background and experiences as a Chinese student. Growing up in a society where education is highly valued, I was exposed to a rigorous academic environment from an early age. This experience instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the power of education. Additionally, coming from a culture rich in tradition and history, I have learned to value diverse perspectives and understand the importance of cultural sensitivity in education. These experiences have not only shaped my academic pursuits but have also given me a unique perspective that I plan to bring to my program at UCLA. I believe that my background will allow me to contribute a distinct viewpoint to discussions and research, particularly in the field of educational inclusivity and diversity.</p><p><strong>2. Engagement in Activities Focused on Supporting Underrepresented Groups</strong></p><p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in initiatives aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in higher education. As Secretary of the Academic Planning Center in College Student Union, I focused on creating inclusive educational programs for all students in need. I organized online study rooms and lectures, and servered as a Advanced Mathematics lecturer to help 200 students from 3 grades who were faced with difficulty in course study. About half of them are racial minorities or international students who might face language barriers or have limited access to academic support. I can still feel the great difficulties they faced. I well prepared 12 courses that cover most of the key knowledge points, and shared my detailed summary notes online to ensure that all these resources were accessible to them. Fortunately, most of my classmates made progress in the following quiz. My efforts were driven by a belief in equil education for all, regardless of their cultural or socioeconomic background.</p><p><strong>3. Plans for Engagement in Graduate Program to Advance Diversity and Equal Opportunity</strong></p><p>During my graduate studies at UCLA, I am also keen on contributing to teaching and mentoring programs, where I can use my experiences to support and inspire students from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, I aim to be involved in community outreach programs that work towards increasing awareness and participation in higher education among historically underrepresented communities.
