I develop a wrapper layer to hold all APIs that can be exposed to maya plugin to call, so the development process can be split into front-end (plugin UI) and back-end (inference). For the inference module, we firstly plugged the pretrained papers into the adapters to ensure the signals flowed, then hot-swapped our own checkpoints as they matured. For the plugin side, we firstly provide only simple buttons to import objects and start the inference pipeline. Then, I developed a level-of-detail control module to pass some controllable parameters to the inference module. Moreover, I developed the Edit mode for users have a better control of skeleton structure, and change the back-end inference module to provide a new pipeline from given skeleton to skinning. Finally, it takes some time for the model to inference, so I change to async processing when call the inference module and add a progress bar.</p><h3 id="how-much-time-did-you-personally-spend-on-this-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-much-time-did-you-personally-spend-on-this-project"><span>How much time did you personally spend on this project?</span></a></h3><p>75 hours</p><h3 id="what-percent-of-the-total-work-was-your-contribution-to-the-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-percent-of-the-total-work-was-your-contribution-to-the-project"><span>What percent of the total work was your contribution to the project?</span></a></h3><p>~50 %.
