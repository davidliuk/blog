How would you define the personality of a manager compared to that of a leader?</strong><br> A manager is rational, organized, and seeks stability; a leader is imaginative, emotionally driven, and comfortable with chaos.</p><p><strong>2. How would you define the workplace objectives of a manager compared to those of a leader? How do they perceive their respective roles in the company?</strong><br> Managers aim to maintain order, efficiency, and meet goals; leaders aim to inspire change, innovate, and set new directions.</p><p><strong>3. Describe a manager‚Äôs relationships with others. What about those of a leader?</strong><br> Managers build structured, role-based relationships with low emotional involvement; leaders form deep, empathetic, and transformative relationships.</p><p><strong>4. Describe a manager‚Äôs sense of self. What about that of a leader?</strong><br> Managers derive self-worth from maintaining and improving systems; leaders derive identity from challenging the status quo and personal vision.</p><p><strong>5. How do managers develop? How do leaders develop? How do ‚Äúonce born‚Äù and ‚Äútwice born‚Äù types relate?</strong><br> Managers develop through socialization into existing systems (&quot;once born&quot;); leaders develop through inner struggle and personal transformation (&quot;twice born&quot;).</p><p><strong>6. From your observations of start-up founders in EAS545 this semester, when is the article relevant or not?</strong><br> Relevant when founders had to inspire teams under uncertainty; less relevant when success depended purely on executing established plans.</p><p><strong>7. Overall, to what extent would you agree or disagree with the author&#39;s point of view?</strong><br> I mostly agree; the distinction between leaders and managers explains many observed startup dynamics, although real individuals often blend both traits.</p><p><strong>8. How does this article relate to the previous article in terms of defining the qualities and role of a leader?</strong><br> Both articles highlight vision, risk-taking, and intrinsic motivation as defining leadership traits, contrasting leaders with efficiency-focused managers.</p><p><strong>9. The article emphasizes that it is important for a leader to ‚Äúbehave in a way that is consistent with who you are.‚Äù Explain.</strong><br> Authenticity builds credibility and endurance; leaders who act contrary to their true selves eventually lose effectiveness.</p><p><strong>10. ‚ÄúDrawing on a deep moral sense‚Äù is important for a leader for what reasons?</strong><br> It provides strength to persist through adversity and anchors decisions in values beyond short-term gains.</p><p><strong>11. A function of leadership is ‚Äúabsorbing uncertainty.‚Äù Explain.</strong><br> Leaders shield their teams from fear and indecision, enabling progress despite unknown outcomes and risks.</p><p><strong>12. What six elements define the framework for assessing the characteristics of a leader? Which have you encountered in EAS5450?</strong><br> The six elements are imagination, commitment, joy, governance, tempered creativity, and tolerance for seeming foolish.<br> We saw imagination, commitment, and absorbing uncertainty in startup founders and guest speakers throughout the semester.</p><p><strong>13. How do these articles relate to: (i) EAS5450 case studies; (ii) guest speakers; and (iii) classroom discussions?</strong><br> (i) Cases highlighted the tension between managing operations and leading growth.<br> (ii) Guest speakers often embodied leadership traits, especially vision and risk tolerance.<br> (iii) Discussions emphasized leadership&#39;s role in innovation and managing ambiguity.</p><p><strong>14. Using the principles presented in our readings for today, describe yourself. Are you a leader or a manager?</strong><br> I am more of a leader: I enjoy creating new ideas, thrive under uncertainty, and prefer setting visions rather than managing existing systems.</p><hr><p>Would you also like me to prepare a super-condensed &quot;cheat sheet&quot; version you can bring into your final review before class, just in case? üìÑ‚úÖ</p>",18)]))}const g=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","28.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/28.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Here are concise and well-organized English answers for each of your questions, ready for your assignment or quiz: 1.
