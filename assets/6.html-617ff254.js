For example, you should always be a good listener,and listen to others&#39;opinions patiently. This shows respect to others. Once,when I was having a conversation with my friend Bob,he often interrupted me while I was talking. I felt so annoyed,because I thought he showed no interest in my talk. It&#39;s very impolite and rude,and it left a bad impression on me.</p><p>What&#39;s more, when you interrupt others,they may forget what to say. It&#39;s very embarrassing. (Interrupting gets in the way of the speaker transmitting their message effectively)</p><ul><li>保持礼仪，人际关系，倾听他人</li><li>避免尴尬</li></ul><h3 id="_4-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4</h3><p>Which do you prefer:home school or sending kids to the public school?</p><hr><p>I think home teaching is better for kids, because they can save commute time. However,if kids study in public schools, they need to waste time commuting back and forth every day.</p><p>Take myself as an example .Time is very precious for me as a student, because every day I&#39;m busy with a lot of things, like taking classes,writing papers, making presentations and so on. Therefore,it&#39;s very important for me to save etime. However,attending the public school is very inconvenient,because I need to spend a lot of time taking the bus or subway to go to school.</p><p>What&#39;s more, studying at home is more efficient, because the environment is more comfortable and quieter. As a result, I can be more focused on learning.</p><ul><li>学生繁忙，节省时间</li><li>提高效率，舒适体验</li></ul><h3 id="_4-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to praise their good behavior or criticize their bad behavior. Explain why.</p><hr><p>I think it&#39;s better to praise good behavior, because it can boost people&#39;s confidence and give them strong motivation to keep going.</p><p>For example,last semester,I joined a speech contest,to be honest,I didn&#39;t have any talent in it,so I was not very confident. I wanted to challenge myself, so I practiced every day. During the process, my parents spoke highly of me, and they gave me a lot of encouragement and support. I felt very motivated,and this kept me practicing every day. Eventually, I got the 2nd prize in the competition,and I was very proud of myself.</p><blockquote><p>diffident</p></blockquote><ul><li>演讲比赛，父母赞赏</li></ul><h3 id="_50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_50" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 50</h3><p>Some people prefer to make friends with people who share similar ages while other people prefer to make friends with people from different age groups.Which one do you agree?
