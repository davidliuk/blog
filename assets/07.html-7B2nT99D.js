Look for a high-tech product advertisement that you believe would be good to incorporate into a Product Concept test. Submit the following as an integrated PDF:</p><ul><li>the advertisement (screen shot and source URL)</li><li>the first question of your concept test</li><li>three follow-up questions you would ask after the initial question</li><li>a brief paragraph describing why you believe the advertisement is good for a concept test</li></ul><p>You may use Word, PowerPoint or another app to create your concept test and generate a PDF for submission.</p><p><strong>NOTE: We will have no quiz today</strong>. However, you should be prepared to apply the principles of <strong>both</strong> Product Concept Testing and Conjoint Analysis to an in-class exercise.</p><hr><p>Word of Mouth</p><p>One Price for a group</p><p>Conjoint</p><p>attribute</p>',17)]))}const c=t(i,[["render",s],["__file","07.html.vue"]]),l=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/07.html","title":"07: Customer Discovery and Market Research","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"07: Customer Discovery and Market Research Review the “Palm Computing: The Pilot Organizer” case (HBS #9-599-040).
