Therefore, it&#39;s very necessary for me to maximize the time efficiency. Last weekend, I needed to write an essay which was due in only one week.

Learning math requires a lot of time and efforts.For example,I started to learn math when I was a student in elementary school,and I had been learning math for at least 10 years.During the process,I learned different math theories and did a lot of practice.</p><p>What&#39;s more, it&#39;s more beneficial for people if they start to learn math when they are students, because it can develop their logical thinking ability, which is also a very crucial ability in working place.

Take myself as an example. I hate writing, and I think taking writing course is very boring. If I am forced to take this class, it must be very easy for me to get distracted.</p><p>What&#39;s more, first year students are very busy, so they have no time to take the courses which are unrelated to their major.
