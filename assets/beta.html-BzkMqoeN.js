This will give users the ability to manually remove or adjust any unnecessary or misidentified joints after the initial auto-rigging process, which is especially useful for complex or stylized models.</p><p>Next, we’ll be implementing <em>batch processing support</em>, allowing users to apply the rigging pipeline to multiple models in a single workflow. This is especially useful for studios or teams working with large character libraries.</p><p>Finally, we’re adding <em>FK/IK rigging options</em>, so users can generate animation-ready controls directly within the tool. This makes the rigs more compatible with common animation pipelines and game engines.”</p><p><strong>Final Deliverables</strong></p><p>“Our end goal is to deliver a tool that <em>automatically creates skeletons and applies skinning</em> based on the input model geometry, with minimal need for manual intervention.</p><p>We’ll also support <em>batch rigging</em>, so teams can process assets at scale efficiently.</p><p>To ensure flexibility, users will be able to <em>control and edit skeletons through parameters or direct manipulation</em>.</p><p>And finally, we’ll provide a <em>simple installer and onboarding guide</em>, so artists and animators can quickly integrate InstaRig into their existing workflow.”</p>',23)]))}const h=t(a,[["render",l],["__file","beta.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/6600/tool/alpha/beta.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Just a reminder that the Wed class this week is a Design Review of the Beta version of your Authoring Tool.
