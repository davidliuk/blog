Brian also established and directed Domain’s initiatives in China including its collaboration with Beijing Elite to create new medical device companies in China based on technology licensed from US and European markets. One such company, Elite Neurovascular, was successfully sold to Terumo Corporation in 2017. Additionally, Brian joined with two scientific founders at Johns Hopkins University to create WindMIL Therapeutics, which is developing a novel cell therapy to treat a variety of cancers. Brian served as President and CEO of WindMIL from 2015 to early 2019, during which time he raised $43.5MM in two rounds of financing. Most recently, Brian formed Nobias Therapeutics alongside co-founders from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to develop drugs to treat rare pediatric disease. He remains CEO of Nobias Therapeutics today. Brian has served on the Board of Directors of Esprit Pharma (acquired by Allergan), Dicerna Therapeutics (Nasdaq: DRNA), Alimera Sciences (Nasdaq: ALIM), and Vanda Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: VNDA).</p><p>Prior to Domain, Brian was an associate with Advanced Technology Ventures where he participated in the firm’s investments in Plexxikon, Percardia and Emphasys. Before that, he was a consultant at the Wilkerson Group, where he developed strategy for pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Brian received his B.S.E. in bioengineering from University of Pennsylvania and his Ph.D. in immunology from Thomas Jefferson University. He is currently an advisor to Elm Street Ventures, an early-stage venture fund with close ties to Yale University.</p><p><strong>THE PANEL:</strong></p><p><strong>Jennifer Friel Goldstein</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-friel-goldstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Friel Goldstein</strong></a> is head of Relationship Management, Technology and Healthcare at <a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong></a>, a division of First Citizens Bank.
