Working in teams of three or four, students will brainstorm an original game concept, write a formal game design document then develop a fully functional prototype consisting of a playable level of the game.</p><p>In addition to creation of original art and animation assets for the game, technical features to be designed and implemented include a novel game mechanic and/or user interaction model, game physics (i.e. particle systems and rigid body dynamics), character animation, game AI (i.e. movement control, path planning, decision making, etc.), sound effects and background music, 2D graphical user interface (GUI) design and optional multiplayer networking capabilities. Consistent with standard industry practices, game code and logic will be written using C++ and popular scripting languages such as Python and Lua. State-of-the-art game and physics engine middleware also will be used to expose students to commercial-grade software, production methodologies and art asset pipelines.</p><p>As a result of their game development efforts, students will learn first hand about the creative process, design documentation, object-oriented software design and engineering, project management (including effective team collaboration and communication techniques), design iteration through user feedback and play-testing, and most importantly, what makes a game fun to play.</p><hr><p><a href="https://doc.photonengine.com/zh-cn/fusion/current/fusion-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photon</a></p><p>Multi-player</p>',13)]))}const d=t(r,[["render",i],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),l=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/upgrade/","title":"UPGRADE","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"UPGRADE GBM https://pennupgrade.com/ https://pennclubs.com/club/upgrade Design Doc 9/7 9/11: Project proposal doc 9/14: receive proposal doc feedback The objective of the game d...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://davidliuk.github.io/blog/blog/education/ms/upgrade/"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"David's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"UPGRADE"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"UPGRADE GBM https://pennupgrade.com/ https://pennclubs.com/club/upgrade Design Doc 9/7 9/11: Project proposal doc 9/14: receive proposal doc feedback The objective of the game d..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-11-09T03:55:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-11-09T03:55:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"UPGRADE\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-11-09T03:55:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"David Liu\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/davidliuk\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1727659735000,"updatedTime":1731124512000,"contributors":[{"name":"刘大维","email":"davidliu@liudaweideMacBook-Pro-3.local","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.83,"words":249},"filePathRelative":"education/ms/upgrade/README.md","localizedDate":"September 30, 2024","excerpt":"\\n<p>GBM</p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://pennupgrade.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://pennupgrade.com/</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://pennclubs.com/club/upgrade\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://pennclubs.com/club/upgrade</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Cnqv7evrCPELC8RHT28efVWH9rHiUNaAy0G3eevFpY/edit\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Design Doc</a></p>","autoDesc":true}`);export{d as comp,l as data};
