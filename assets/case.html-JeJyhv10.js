The case provides background information on the conditions, attitudes and practices leading up to that time in the company’s history. It then<br> describes the problem or event facing the company at the time of the case. Where appropriate, data is provided on alternative courses of action.</p><p>A case attempts to simulate a real life situation. Consequently, the arrangement of facts is often unstructured and purposely requires rearrangement, filtering and interpretation, including the evaluation of opinions and behavior. Most information will be relevant to the situation facing the company, though some may be irrelevant. Often, as in the real situation, not all information one would desire is available. You are put in the shoes of the decision-maker and asked to make decisions based on your analysis of the available data.</p><p>Cases for the course were selected for their effectiveness in illustrating specific, often critical, issues faced in high tech entrepreneurial ventures. Many of the analytical techniques, decision frameworks, concepts and guidelines covered in class lectures and readings will be useful to assess alternatives and determine the best course of action. As in real life, there may be several acceptable solutions to the case. Definitive answers to case situations are rarely, if ever, available.</p><h2 id="preparing-a-case-analysis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#preparing-a-case-analysis"><span>PREPARING A CASE ANALYSIS</span></a></h2><p>Typically about <strong>two hours</strong> of study time are needed to read and analyze a case. Although no single method of study works for everyone, the following guidelines may be helpful:</p><ul><li>Read the <strong>introductory</strong> paragraphs, which provide an overview of the situation at hand, then <strong>skim</strong> the case quickly to get a feel for what the case is about and what information you are being given.</li><li>Read the <strong>study questions</strong>, which are provided by the instructor as part of the day’s assignment as an aid for case analysis and class preparation.</li><li>Next read the case carefully, <strong>underlining</strong> key facts as you go. It is sometimes helpful to construct a <strong>timeline</strong> of these facts on a separate sheet of paper. Sometimes a simple organization chart also helps to keep the players straight. At this point, put yourself in the place of the decision-maker and develop a sense of involvement in the situation he or she is facing.</li><li>Then go through the case again and, on a separate sheet of paper, sort out the relevant <strong>considerations</strong> (e.g., pros and cons) for the key problem(s).</li><li>Finally, develop your solution based upon your analysis of the problem(s) and relevant considerations.</li></ul><h2 id="closed-book-quizzes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closed-book-quizzes"><span>CLOSED-BOOK QUIZZES</span></a></h2><p>In-class quizzes are announced in advance in the day’s assignment. They are <strong>closed-book</strong>, closed-notes and take about 10-15 minutes of class time. Quiz questions are typically derived from the study questions provided by the instructor as part of the case assignment. While the quiz question may not exactly duplicate a study question, it usually will relate to the substance of one or more of the study questions. To prepare for a closed-book quiz, be sure you are prepared to address each of the posted study questions.</p>',9)]))}const h=t(n,[["render",o],["__file","case.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/case.html","title":"Case Method","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Case Method One of the primary learning techniques in the Engineering Entrepreneurship curriculum is the “case method.” Each of our case studies this semester describes an actua...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://davidliuk.github.io/blog/blog/education/ms/5450/case.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"David's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Case Method"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Case Method One of the primary learning techniques in the Engineering Entrepreneurship curriculum is the “case method.” Each of our case studies this semester describes an actua..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-01-28T23:13:40.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-01-28T23:13:40.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Case Method\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-01-28T23:13:40.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"David Liu\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/davidliuk\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"PREPARING A CASE ANALYSIS","slug":"preparing-a-case-analysis","link":"#preparing-a-case-analysis","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"CLOSED-BOOK QUIZZES","slug":"closed-book-quizzes","link":"#closed-book-quizzes","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1738106020000,"updatedTime":1738106020000,"contributors":[{"name":"David","email":"l729641074@163.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.8,"words":540},"filePathRelative":"education/ms/5450/case.md","localizedDate":"January 28, 2025","excerpt":"\\n<p>One of the primary learning techniques in the Engineering Entrepreneurship curriculum is the “case method.” Each of our case studies this semester describes an actual situation facing a decision-maker in a high tech startup.
