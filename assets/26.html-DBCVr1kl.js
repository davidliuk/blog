How and why were horizontal and vertical organizational expansions incorporated into this scaling up process? How well has the company handled each stage of this scale up?

What is your opinion of their alternative “build it and they will come” model?</li><li>Is aggressive development of Gen II, III and IV reactors in the best interests of the company? Why or why not?</li><li>What remains to be done for N12 to become, in Berkson’s words, a “buttoned-up organization?”</li><li>Looking at the company’s future prospects, would you invest in N12?
