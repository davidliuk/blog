Do you think Collins’ conclusions are supported by the cases we have studied this term?</p><p>Read the “<a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/e0368be9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vinod Khosla and Sun Microsystems (A)</strong></a>” case. This is a very interesting case about the startup days of Sun Microsystems which was acquired by Oracle in 2010 (<a href="https://www.oracle.com/it-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oracle.com/it-infrastructure/</a> and <a href="https://www.java.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.java.com</a>). Think about how you would answer the following study questions during your analysis of the case:</p><ul><li>Does Vinod Khosla have a real chance of changing Computervision’s decision? Does Sun have a better product? Can Sun be regarded as a reliable long-term vendor?</li><li>How should Vinod Khosla respond to Computervision’s president? What should his long-term and short-term objective be? Specifically, what should he offer Computervision?</li><li>For Sun, what are the consequences of not doing this deal?</li><li>If you are in CEO James Berrett’s shoes at the time of the case, from Computervision’s perspective what are your concerns, both pro and con, of doing the deal with Sun Microsystems instead of Apollo?</li><li>Would you make a different decision than Computervision? Explain.</li><li>Sun Microsytems and MIPS (the company we studied in our last class) were started at about the same time (1982 and 1984, respectively). How did Sun’s approach to starting its business differ from that of MIPS (which we studied last week), and why does this lend itself better to a successful outcome?</li></ul><p><strong>DUE:</strong></p><p>There will be a short <strong>12-minute</strong> closed-book, closed-notes quiz on one or more of today’s readings <strong>at the beginning of class</strong>.

Does Sun have a better product? Can Sun be regarded as a reliable long-term vendor?</strong></span></a></h3><p>Khosla has little chance to change the decision—Computervision was already finalizing its deal with Apollo. Technologically, Sun offers a superior product: open standards (UNIX, Ethernet), modular design, and strong engineering talent. However, as a young startup with only 40 employees and limited OEM track record, Sun lacks the credibility to be seen as a reliable long-term vendor.</p><hr><h3 id="_2-how-should-vinod-khosla-respond-to-computervision-s-president-what-should-his-long-term-and-short-term-objective-be-specifically-what-should-he-offer-computervision" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-how-should-vinod-khosla-respond-to-computervision-s-president-what-should-his-long-term-and-short-term-objective-be-specifically-what-should-he-offer-computervision"><span>2. <strong>How should Vinod Khosla respond to Computervision’s president?

Apollo would further solidify its dominance, making it harder for Sun to attract other OEMs. It would also slow Sun’s transition from academia to commercial markets, limiting growth and reducing its appeal to investors.</p><hr><h3 id="_4-if-you-are-in-ceo-james-berrett-s-shoes-what-are-the-concerns—both-pro-and-con—of-doing-the-deal-with-sun-instead-of-apollo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-if-you-are-in-ceo-james-berrett-s-shoes-what-are-the-concerns—both-pro-and-con—of-doing-the-deal-with-sun-instead-of-apollo"><span>4. <strong>If you are in CEO James Berrett’s shoes, what are the concerns—both pro and con—of doing the deal with Sun instead of Apollo?</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Superior technology, open architecture, better long-term flexibility, and strong university adoption.</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong> Sun is young, undercapitalized, and unproven at scale; Apollo is stable, well-funded, and already supporting similar OEMs. Risking a core product line on Sun could endanger Computervision’s market position.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="_5-would-you-make-a-different-decision-than-computervision-explain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-would-you-make-a-different-decision-than-computervision-explain"><span>5. <strong>Would you make a different decision than Computervision? Explain.</strong></span></a></h3><p>Given the risk profile in 1983, I would likely stick with Apollo. It was the safer, proven option. However, if Computervision had a high appetite for innovation and could structure a low-risk pilot with Sun, I would consider it as a forward-looking strategic move.</p><hr><h3 id="_6-how-did-sun-s-approach-differ-from-mips-and-why-did-it-lend-itself-better-to-success" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-how-did-sun-s-approach-differ-from-mips-and-why-did-it-lend-itself-better-to-success"><span>6. <strong>How did Sun’s approach differ from MIPS, and why did it lend itself better to success?</strong></span></a></h3><p>Sun focused on assembling a world-class founding team (“First Who”), using off-the-shelf components, targeting the university market, and building scalable, open systems. In contrast, MIPS was highly tech-centric, focused on proprietary RISC chips, and overly reliant on OEMs. Sun’s pragmatic, customer-driven strategy allowed faster market entry, revenue generation, and credibility building—aligning well with Collins’ “First Who, Then What” principle.</p>',28)]))}const h=o(a,[["render",r],["__file","25.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/25.html","title":"25: Sun Microsystems, First Who...","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"25: Sun Microsystems, First Who...
