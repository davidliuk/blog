Admittedly, tax revenue for public transportation will be a cost for all the people. However, taking accountability for the benefit of public transportation, I am inclined to support the tax revenue for public transportation. In other words, the convenience brought by public transportation is of great significance of the promotion of the overall society&#39;s efficiency. Not only can public transportation provide more jobs, but also can alleviate the burden of those with limited income. For example, during my internship in Beijing, thanks to the police university students can take public transportation for free during summer vacation, I save a lot of money for my everyday commuting.</p><h3 id="free-edu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#free-edu"><span>free edu</span></a></h3><blockquote><p>42-&gt;88</p></blockquote><p>Rory articulates a compelling argument that free college education can be challenging.

While it is true that free college education would require significant financial investment, I believe it is crucial for the government to acknowledge its responsibility in promoting the overall welfare of society.

By providing equal access to higher education, free college education can create a more equitable and harmonious society. It not only facilitates high-quality employment opportunities but also alleviates the financial burden on individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.
