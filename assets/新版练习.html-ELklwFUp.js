However, taking accountability for the benefit of public transportation, I am inclined to support the tax revenue for public transportation. In other words, the convenience brought by public transportation is of great significance of the promotion of the overall society&#39;s efficiency. Not only can public transportation provide more jobs, but also can alleviate the burden of those with limited income. For example, during my internship in Beijing, thanks to the police university students can take public transportation for free during summer vacation, I save a lot of money for my everyday commuting.</p><h3 id="free-edu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#free-edu"><span>free edu</span></a></h3><blockquote><p>42-&gt;88</p></blockquote><p>Rory articulates a compelling argument that free college education can be challenging.
