However,only taking exams cannot improve students&#39;ability.For example,last time,our history professor asked us to write a paper about American history.I did a lot of research about this topic, like reading reference books and journals,surfing information online and watching some videos.All these could help me have a better understanding of the topic.Besides,it&#39;s also beneficial for students&#39;study if they need to complete some projects,because during the process,students can have some group discussions, which can help them learn from each other&#39;s different ideas.</p><h3 id="_10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_10" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 10</h3><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?A school should no longer require students to do experiments but show students the videos of experiments.Why?Include reasons and examples to support your response.</p><hr><p>I agree that the school should no longer require students to do experiments but show students the videos of experiments,because doing experiments is very complicated and time-consuming.Time is very precious for students,because they are busy with a lot of things,such as taking classes,writing homework,doing part-time jobs and so on.However,doing an experiment costs a lot of time, I mean,you need to go to the lab,prepare some materials,and do the experiment step by step by yourself.Besides,doing experiments can sometimes be very dangerous.For instance,when students do some chemistry experiments,they may start a fire in the lab,which will put their life at risk.</p><h3 id="_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1</h3><p>Some people like to get advice from their parents.Others prefer to get advice from their peers.

However,if I review the notes just before tests,I may not have enough time to process all the information.I am a university student who has a lot of classes every day.I often take notes in class and review them every night before asleep.When I encounter some difficult problems,I will communicate with my professors or classmates immediately to solve them.Therefore, before the test,I feel at east because I already mastered what I have learned.What&#39;s more,it&#39;s too risky to review the notes just before tests,coz I may come across some emergencies.</p><h3 id="_1-5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-5" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1</h3><p>Which one do you prefer:a leader who makes quick decisions without consulting others or a leader who asks for the opinions of other group members?</p><hr><p>I prefer a leader who asks for the opinions of other group members, because they can discuss together to make better decisions.However, if the leader just makes a quick decision,maybe he or she will make a mistake and the whole team suffers.Last summer vacation,I worked in a local company,our boss Fancy was very friendly and nice.She often discussed with all the group members in the company when she needed to make some important decisions.During the discussion,all the members exchanged their different ideas and thoughts,so that Fancy could make better decisions.This is good for the company.Besides,this can form a close relationship between the boss and the employees,because the employees feel respected.</p>',12);function b(w,k){const o=h("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),i("div",null,[c,e("p",null,[t("I think college students should join clubs and enjoy club activities in their spare time,because it can help them relieve their stress and expand their social circles.However,studying in spare time makes students feel tired and stressed-out.Take myself as an example.I'm a university student who is super busy every day,such as taking classes,writing homework,doing part- time jobs and so on.I often feel tired and stressed out.Therefore,I need to take a break and do something for fun.Joining in club activities is a pretty good choice,because during the process,I can forget all the stress and tension in study.What's more,I can make friends with new people who have different "),e("a",l,[t("backgrounds.In"),s(o)]),t(" this way,it can expand my social circle.")]),u,m,p,f,e("p",null,[t("What's more,high school students are very tired and stressed- out,taking music and art classes can let them reduce their "),e("a",y,[t("stress.It"),s(o)]),t("'s good for their mental health.Therefore,I think it's very necessary for high school students to take music and art classes.")]),g])}const I=r(d,[["render",b],["__file","2.html.vue"]]);export{I as default};
