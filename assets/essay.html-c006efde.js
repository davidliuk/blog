A response to both prompts is required. This is an opportunity for you to give us a stronger sense of who you are, as a person. Your essay should be as unique as you and should be written using your own voice. Include each prompt as the header for each of your two responses.</p><p>When finished, combine your response to both prompts into one, single PDF and upload it below. Your total essay upload should be 12pt Arial font and no more than two pages, double-spaced, in length.</p><p>Prompt 1: Drawing from your previous academic, professional and personal experiences, tell us what has attracted you to the program of study you have noted in your application. Be very specific about your past experiences and how they shaped your interests.</p><p>Prompt 2: Students often have a wide range of ideas and plans for what they hope to achieve after they receive their graduate degree. Tell us what your 5-year plan is after completing a degree from NYU Tandon.</p><hr><p>In a transformative era, AI is a fundamental force reshaping our world.

By using the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing, I made the peak performance of resource recalculation 20 times faster. Moreover, I refactored the activity page AI auto-generation service for the AI Pilot Marketing platform. I organized the functions with the Strategy Pattern to generate each content floor with AIGC and LLM services effectively. I also collaborated with Machine Learning Engineer colleagues to design the options and pipelines of the service, which strengthened my skills in AI-driven software solutions and deepened my understanding of user-centered design.
