Focus your questions on our speaker’s career path leading up to, and contributing to, his entrepreneurial venture, and the current development of this startup company. Submit your list of questions via Canvas before the beginning of class. Questions will be graded on their substance, relevancy to engineering entrepreneurship, and the evident level of effort in your research about the speaker. Vague, generic, or off-point questions of little substance will be penalized.</p><p>Out of courtesy to our speaker plan to arrive at class a few minutes early so the class can begin on time without interruption.</p>',8)]))}const c=t(o,[["render",s],["__file","17.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/17.html","title":"17: GUEST - Ross Mechanic","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"17: GUEST - Ross Mechanic NOTE: We will be combining the two 10:15a sections in 217 Towne today.
