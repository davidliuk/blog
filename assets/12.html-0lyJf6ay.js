The two models differ in approach, risk tolerance, and flexibility.</li><li><strong>What is bootstrap finance? Why is it advantageous for entrepreneurs?</strong><br> Bootstrap finance refers to starting and growing a business using personal savings, revenue, and minimal external funding. It allows entrepreneurs to retain control, remain adaptable, and develop financial discipline without investor pressure.</li><li><strong>What are &quot;the hidden costs of other people&#39;s money&quot;?</strong><br> External funding can lead to premature scaling, misaligned incentives, loss of control, and reduced flexibility in decision-making. Investors may resist pivots or demand rapid growth, increasing the risk of failure.</li><li><strong>What are the seven axioms of successful entrepreneurs, and why are they effective?</strong><ol><li><strong>Get operational quickly</strong> – Avoid over-planning and start generating revenue early.</li><li><strong>Pursue quick break-even projects</strong> – Focus on cash flow over long-term profitability.</li><li><strong>Sell high-value products/services</strong> – Allows direct sales without a large marketing budget.</li><li><strong>Forget about a “perfect” team</strong> – Start with affordable, adaptable employees.</li><li><strong>Control growth carefully</strong> – Expand only when financially sustainable.</li><li><strong>Prioritize cash over profits or market share</strong> – Ensures survival and financial stability.</li><li><strong>Build banking relationships early</strong> – Helps secure financing when the business matures.<br> These principles ensure resilience, financial discipline, and adaptability in uncertain markets.</li></ol></li></ul><hr><h3 id="raising-startup-capital" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#raising-startup-capital"><span><strong>Raising Startup Capital</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>What are the differences between debt financing and equity financing?</strong><br> Debt financing involves borrowing capital that must be repaid with interest, while equity financing exchanges ownership stakes for investment. Debt provides control but requires repayment, whereas equity offers capital without fixed repayment but dilutes ownership.</li><li><strong>What is convertible debt? How does it reflect elements of both types of financing?</strong><br> Convertible debt starts as a loan but converts into equity at a later stage, often at a discount. It combines the flexibility of debt with the potential upside of equity, allowing startups to delay valuation while securing early funding.</li><li><strong>What’s the major advantage of raising *less* money?</strong><br> Less funding reduces dilution, increases founder control, and prevents unnecessary spending. It also allows for more strategic financing later at higher valuations.</li><li><strong>What are the typical stages of investment, and what funding sources are used in each stage?</strong><ol><li><strong>Seed stage</strong> – Personal savings, angel investors, crowdfunding.</li><li><strong>Series A</strong> – Venture capital, accelerators, early-stage funds.</li><li><strong>Series B</strong> – Larger VC firms, strategic investors.</li><li><strong>Series C+</strong> – Late-stage VC, private equity, IPO preparation.<br> Funding supports product development, team expansion, scaling, and market penetration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>How is a venture capital firm structured? Who are the different stakeholders?</strong><br> VC firms consist of: <ul><li><strong>General Partners (GPs)</strong> – Manage funds and make investment decisions.</li><li><strong>Limited Partners (LPs)</strong> – Investors providing capital (pension funds, endowments).</li><li><strong>Principals/Associates</strong> – Support investment research and deal execution.</li><li><strong>Entrepreneurs-in-Residence (EIRs)</strong> – Experts advising startups within the firm.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What do venture capital investors look for in a deal?</strong><br> Strong founding team, large market opportunity, scalable business model, defensible competitive advantage, and clear exit potential (acquisition or IPO).</li><li><strong>What is crowdfunding? What are its advantages and disadvantages?</strong><br> Crowdfunding raises small amounts of money from many individuals via platforms like Kickstarter or AngelList. <ul><li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Quick access to capital, market validation, community engagement.</li><li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Limited funds, public idea exposure, potential lack of experienced investors.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Who are angel investors? How do they differ from VCs? What are the advantages and disadvantages?</strong><br> Angel investors are wealthy individuals who invest early-stage capital, often with mentorship. <ul><li><strong>Differences</strong>: Angels invest personal money in smaller deals; VCs manage institutional funds for larger investments.</li><li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Flexible terms, industry expertise, faster decisions.</li><li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Limited follow-on funding, less structured support.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the role of accelerators/incubators? When are they appropriate?</strong><br> Accelerators/incubators provide mentorship, resources, and small investments in exchange for equity. They are best for early-stage startups refining their product, seeking funding, or needing networking opportunities.</li><li><strong>What are sources of non-dilutive funding? What are its benefits?</strong><br> Non-dilutive funding includes grants, government programs, revenue-based financing, and R&amp;D tax credits. It provides capital without diluting ownership, allowing founders to maintain control.</li><li><strong>What is pre- and post-money valuation? How are these values determined?</strong><ul><li><strong>Pre-money valuation</strong>: A startup’s value before new investment.</li><li><strong>Post-money valuation</strong>: The valuation after investment (Pre-money + new investment).<br> These are determined based on market potential, traction, and comparable industry valuations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What is an option pool? Why is it important to entrepreneurs?</strong><br> An option pool is a reserved share of equity for future employees. It affects founder dilution and valuation, as investors often require a large pool before funding rounds.</li><li><strong>What are the principal elements of a venture capital deal? How do liquidation preference and control impact entrepreneurs?</strong><ul><li><strong>Key elements</strong>: Valuation, ownership percentage, liquidation preference, voting rights, board control.</li><li><strong>Liquidation preference</strong>: Ensures investors recover funds first in a sale, often at a multiple.</li><li><strong>Control</strong>: Investors may secure board seats and voting rights, potentially reducing founder autonomy.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>Venture Capital</p><p>Venture Pool</p><p>present value, future value</p><p>Time Value of Money</p><p>Opportunity Cost</p><p>Future Value Analysis</p><p>Compound</p><p>bank</p><p>Risk return trade off</p><p>Account Receivable</p><hr><p>Bootstrapping: reinvestment</p><p>need a lot of capital to start, use bootstrapping</p><p>safe: an agreement, convert to future equity</p><p>post money valuation</p><p>pre money valuation</p><hr><p>Equity, Debt</p><p>Investor Protections</p><ul><li>minimal</li><li>May have discount on future share price</li></ul>',38)]))}const d=t(r,[["render",o],["__file","12.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/education/ms/5450/12.html","title":"12: Bootstrapping and Raising Capital","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"12: Bootstrapping and Raising Capital Today we start our module on venture finance and fund-raising.
