Kids can use their pocket money to buy things they like,such as comic books,snacks and toys.Therefore,money is a tangible evidence of what they&#39;ve accomplished.</p><p>What&#39;s more,kids are not mature and self-controlled,so they need this kind of external rewards.Otherwise,it&#39;s easy for them to lose interest in study.</p><h3 id="_3-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3</h3><p>Some people prefer to give their opinions immediately.Others prefer to wait and listen to others&#39;opinions before giving their own.Which one do you think is better?</p><hr><p>In my opinion,waiting and listening to others&#39;opinions before giving my opinion would be a better idea,because it means I&#39;m a good listener and it shows respect to others.However,if I speak out my opinions immediately,I may sound impolite and rude.Having a good manner plays a very important role in our life,because it enables you to maintain good interpersonal relationships with others.For example,you should always be a good listener,and listen to others&#39;opinions patiently This can leave a good impression on others.</p><p>What&#39;s more,you will make fewer mistakes by listening to others first,for you can listen to others&#39; opinions and think about them carefully.</p><h3 id="_3-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3</h3><p>Participating in team sports is a good way for young person to learn team cooperation,do you agree or disagree?</p><hr><p>I agree that participating in team sports is a good way for young person to learn team cooperation, because you need to cooperate with your fellow teammates.Working as a team teaches one to keep personal differences aside and focus on what&#39;s good for the team.For example,the basketball game provides great opportunities to teach people to be unselfish as they work together to score and win. When you are selfish on the basketball court,your whole team suffers.</p><p>Second,in team sports,your teammates are different people who have different personalities and backgrounds.You need to learn how to cooperate with them and help the team to win the game.Therefore,doing team sports can definitely help young people to be more cooperative.</p><h4 id="_3-3" tabindex="-1"><a

money to increase your experience like going for a vacation or a concert?Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.</p><hr><p>I prefer to spend the money on experience,because it broadens my horizon and enhances my knowledge, which helps in enriching my life.However,some objects like electronic products are upgraded so fast,so spending too much money on them is not worthwhile.For example,last summer vacation,I used the money I earned from part-time job to travel to U.S.with my friends.We did a lot of interesting things there,such as visiting museums,tasting local food,talking with the locals so on.I just got to know more about American cultures and custom and got a better understanding of the people living there.We just had a great fun in the trip.What&#39;s more,traveling is a great way for me to forget all the stress and tension in my daily life so that I will feel more energized to get back to normal life.</p><h3 id="_3-4"
