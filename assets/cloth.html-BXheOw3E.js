One Thing I Liked</span></a></h2><p>I found the way the authors handle constraints particularly interesting. Instead of relying on traditional penalty forces, which can introduce unnecessary stiffness and slow down the simulation, they integrate constraint enforcement directly into the solver. This approach ensures that constraints are maintained exactly, without requiring excessive computational effort. This method not only improves numerical stability but also allows the system to take much larger time steps without sacrificing realism.</p><h2 id="_5-what-i-did-not-like" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-what-i-did-not-like"><span>5. What I Did Not Like</span></a></h2><p>While the paper presents an efficient and stable method, it lacks a deeper discussion on the visual fidelity of the simulation compared to real-world fabrics. The authors focus primarily on numerical stability and computational performance, but there is little evaluation of how well their simulated cloth matches the physical behavior of real fabrics. More qualitative analysis or comparisons with real-world data would strengthen their claims about realism.</p><h2 id="_6-questions-for-the-authors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-questions-for-the-authors"><span>6.
