Louis Agassiz was a 19th century professor of the natural sciences. He is renowned for having revolutionized learning methods in this country. However, he is also known as a racist, and disturbingly, he used many of the scientific techniques that we use today to conduct unethical experiments. Agassiz’s checkered history notwithstanding, the application of these principles to entrepreneurship, are important for our program. Think about the relevance of Agassiz’s method to the discipline of the high-tech entrepreneur.
