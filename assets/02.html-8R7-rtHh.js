Louis Agassiz was a 19th century professor of the natural sciences. He is renowned for having revolutionized learning methods in this country. However, he is also known as a racist, and disturbingly, he used many of the scientific techniques that we use today to conduct unethical experiments. Agassiz’s checkered history notwithstanding, the application of these principles to entrepreneurship, are important for our program. Think about the relevance of Agassiz’s method to the discipline of the high-tech entrepreneur.

Study the five “discovery skills” that distinguish visionary entrepreneurs. Think carefully about the relevance of the above Agassiz article to the findings of this article. What discipline and skills are common to both? Relate these skills to yourself. Following advice from this article, what can you do to sharpen your personal innovation skills?
