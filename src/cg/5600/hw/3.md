# HW3

You will create a rasterizer for drawing scenes composed of 2D and 3D polygons. To begin, you will develop a 2D triangle rasterization algorithm and test your implementation on scenes composed of 2D polygons. Then, you will implement a perspective projection camera in order to project 3D polygons down into 2D space to be rasterized. You will code your own classes using C++ and will have your first exposure to the Qt code libraries.
