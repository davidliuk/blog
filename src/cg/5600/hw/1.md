## Help Log (5 points)

Maintain a log of all help you receive and resources you use. Make sure the date and time, the names of everyone you work with or get help from, and every URL you use, except as noted in the collaboration policy. Also briefly log your question, bug or the topic you were looking up/discussing. Ideally, you should also the answer to your question or solution to your bug. This will help you learn and provide a useful reference for future assignments and exams. This also helps us know if there is a topic that people are finding difficult.

If you did not use external resources or otherwise receive help, please submit a help log that states you did not receive external help.

You may submit your help log as an ASCII (plain) text file or as a PDF. Refer to the Policies section of the course web site for more specifications.
