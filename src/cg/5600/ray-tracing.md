# Ray tracing

What is raytracing?

● Computer graphics technique used to simulate the way light bounces off surfaces

● Render fairly realistic-looking images without having to fully simulate the infinitely-many photons light sources give off

● Trace light paths backwards, from camera to light source(s)
