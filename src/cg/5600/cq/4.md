# Concept Questions for HW03

- (5 pts) In the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), what is a uniform variable? What is an "in" variable? What is an "out" variable? How does a vertex shader pass data to a fragment shader?
- (5 pts) MyGL contains two member variables that are std::unordered_maps. What do the GLuints that these maps store represent? How are they assigned values in the first place?

## Question 1

### uniform

Uniforms are **constant** across all instances of a  shader program. It retains the same value across all processed vertices or fragments. Uniforms are typically used for constants that do not change during the execution of a draw call, such as transformation matrices, lighting parameters, or texture samplers.

### **"in"** variable

An **"in"** variable in GLSL is an input to a shader stage. In a vertex shader, "in" variables typically represent vertex attributes (e.g., position, normal, texture coordinates). In a fragment shader, "in" variables represent the interpolated outputs from the vertex shader.

### **"out"** variable

An **"out"** variable in GLSL is an output from a shader stage. In a vertex shader, "out" variables represent data that will be passed on to the next stage, which is typically the fragment shader. In a fragment shader, "out" variables represent the final color or other data to be written to the framebuffer.

### pass data

A vertex shader passes data to a fragment shader by declaring **out** variables, which are then received as **in** variables in the fragment shader.

## Question 2

### represent

The **GLuints** in the two `std::unordered_maps` represent the CPU-side handles for the **"in"** (attribute) and **uniform** variables defined in the shader program. Each key in the maps is the literal name of the variable as specified in the shader (e.g., `vs_Pos` for attributes and `u_ScreenDimensions` for uniforms), and each value is the handle (type `GLint`) associated with that variable.

### assigned values

These handles are assigned values by using the OpenGL functions `glGetAttribLocation` and `glGetUniformLocation`. When the `getHandlesForShaderVariables` function is called, it activates the specified shader program and retrieves the location of each variable in the shader. The obtained handle IDs are then stored in `shaderAttribVariableHandles` and `shaderUniformVariableHandles` with their corresponding variable names as keys.
