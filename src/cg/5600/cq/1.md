# Concept Questions for HW01

## Question 1

### Mathematical Difference:

1. vec4 operator*(const vec4 &v) const (Line 89): This multiplies a matrix (mat4) by a column vector (vec4), i.e., m * v. The matrix applies a transformation to the vector.
2. vec4 operator*(const vec4 &v, const mat4 &m) (Line 106): This multiplies a row vector (vec4) by a matrix (mat4), i.e., v * m. This may result in a different transformation, as the multiplication order is reversed.

### Explanation of const:

1. const vec4 &v: The vector v is passed as a constant reference, meaning it cannot be modified inside the function.
2. const mat4 &m: The matrix m is passed as a constant reference, ensuring it isn't modified.
3. const after the function: Ensures that the matrix object calling the function is not modified.

## Question 2

1. **First function (line 25)**:

   ```
   float operator[](unsigned int index) const;
   ```

   This version can **only** be used when the `vec4` object is **const**, as it provides read-only access to the vector's elements.

   **Situation**:

   - If you have a `const vec4` object, you can **only use this version** to access its elements because the vector cannot be modified. For example:

     ```
     const vec4 v(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);
     float x = v[0];  // Accesses the first element, but cannot modify it.
     ```

2. **Second function (line 28)**:

   ```
   float& operator[](unsigned int index);
   ```

   This version can **only** be used with **non-const `vec4` objects**, as it provides modifiable access to the elements.

   **Situation**:

   - When you want to **modify an element** of a `vec4`, you use this version. For instance:

     ```
     vec4 v(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f);
     v[0] = 5.0f;  // Modifies the first element of the vector.
     ```

In summary:

- The first function is used when **reading values** from a `const vec4`.
- The second function is used when you need to **modify elements** in a **non-const vec4**.
