# Project 1: Modeling from Reference

Start Assignment

This project teaches the importance of observation, measurement, and reference when creating accurate 3D models. You will visit the Penn Museum to select 2-3 objects, one of which will be selected in class as a 3D modeling subject. During the site visit, you will take detailed measurements, sketches, and reference photographs to aid in the creation of your 3D model. You will begin by blocking in the object according to scale and reference, and progressively iterate to add more detail each week. You will light and render a 10-second turntable of this object (240 frames, 1080p @ 24 fps).

**First Maya Modeling Project: Sword of Soul**

For my first Maya modeling project, I chose to model the "Sword of Soul." The reason I picked this item was because its shape is **structured** and **symmetrical** (, featuring circular shapes, cylinders, rings, and a blade). I felt that this would be a manageable and ideal choice for a beginner.

**Expectations vs. Outcome**  

I expected the blade’s curvature to be smooth and refined, which I initially planned to achieve using Maya’s smooth tool. However, it became difficult to apply smooth without affecting other details like the arrow decoration. To maintain control over the curvature of the blade, I ended up adding more edge loops to manually manage the shape and keep the transitions smooth.

I expected to create a smooth, clean model with sharp edges where necessary, especially around the blade and decorative arrow. However, when I applied the smooth tool to the entire blade, the sharpness of the arrow decoration was compromised, causing it to distort. Because of this, I decided not to use the smooth operation on the blade at all, keeping the details intact.

**What I Learned**  
I learned a lot about how smooth operations in Maya can affect different parts of the model. It became clear that some areas, like the arrow decoration, require careful handling to preserve their sharpness, even when the rest of the model needs smoothing.

**Things to Improve Next Time**  
Next time, I will take extra care when applying smooth to specific parts of the model, especially when sharp details are involved. I’ll explore better ways to control the smoothing process, such as using edge loops or applying smooth selectively, to ensure key design elements remain intact.

This version captures your decision to avoid smoothing the blade and highlights the lesson learned about selectively applying tools like smooth.
