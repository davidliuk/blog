Good morning! I make a payment for a book, but it told me payment failure. I try it again an fail again. But actually The bank card has been debited twice ($265.2 * 2).

**My name is [Your Full Name], and I am calling regarding an issue with a payment I attempted to make.**

**Yesterday, September 8th, around 5:50 PM Eastern Time, I tried to process a payment. Although I received a message indicating that the payment failed, my credit card was charged twiceâ€”once at 5:56 PM and again at 6:04 PM Eastern Time.**

**Here are the details of the transactions:**

- **Name on the Credit Card:** Dawei Liu or David Liu
- **Transaction Date:** September 8th
- **Transaction Times:** 5:56 PM and 6:04 PM (Eastern Time)

**I have not yet created the order due to this payment issue. I would like your assistance with the following:**

1. **Confirming the charges on my credit card.**
2. **Providing a refund for the duplicate transactions.**
3. **Clarifying why the payment failed but was still processed.**

**Could you please look into this matter and let me know if you need any additional information from me?**

**Thank you very much for your assistance.**

**Best regards,**
