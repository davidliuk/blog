### [1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank/)

Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank **every day**.

He starts by putting in `$1` on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in `$1` more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in `$1` more than the **previous Monday**.

Given `n`, return *the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the* `nth` *day.*

```java
public int totalMoney(int n) {
    int m = n / 7;
    int F = 28;
    int L = F + (m - 1) * 7;
    return m * (F + L) / 2 + (n % 7) * ((1 + m) + (m + (n % 7))) / 2;
}
```
