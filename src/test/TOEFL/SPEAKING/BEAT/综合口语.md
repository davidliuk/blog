重点【补充例证细节：尽量详尽】

When people are driving along the road, they may see plenty of advertising billboards. Even though drivers may not consciously remember them, these advertisements still affect them.

For instance, an advertisement for the car brand 'Panther' features a large image with the car's name in giant letters. When asked if they saw any car advertisements, many will say 'no' because they have no conscious memory of it. 

However, when asked to name an animal beginning with the letter 'P,' they will say 'Panther' even if 'Pig' is the first animal people think of beginning with the letter 'P.' 

最后【总结Lecture要点】

That is to say, the advertisement of 'Panther' has an influence on these people, although they don’t remember seeing it.
