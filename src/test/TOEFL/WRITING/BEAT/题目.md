Amy presents a compelling argument against implementing taxes on public transportation. While tax revenue for public transportation would be a cost for everyone, I am inclined to support it due to the benefits it brings. Public transportation plays a significant role in promoting overall societal efficiency and convenience. It not only provides more accessibility but also alleviates the financial burden on low-income individuals. 

For example, during my internship in Beijing, I saved a considerable amount of money on daily commuting thanks to the policy allowing university students to use public transportation for free during summer vacation. 

Therefore, despite the cost, implementing taxes for public transportation is crucial for the betterment of society.
