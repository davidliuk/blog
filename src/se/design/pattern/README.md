GoF 23

- Creational Design Patterns 创建型
- Structural Design Patterns 结构型
  - **Decorator Pattern**: The Decorator Pattern allows you to add new behaviors or responsibilities to objects without altering their existing code. It’s like adding layers of wrapping to a gift.
  - **Adapter Pattern**: The Adapter Pattern allows one class to work with another class that has a different interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
  - **Proxy Pattern**: The Proxy Pattern provides a placeholder of another object to control access to it. It’s like having a remote control for a TV; you interact with the remote instead of directly with the TV.

- Behavioral Design Patterns 行为型
  - **Observer Pattern:** The Observer Pattern establishes a relationship where one thing (called the subject) is watched by several other things (knows as observers).
  - **State Pattern:** The State Pattern enables an object to modify how it behaves as its internal state changes.
  - **Strategy Pattern:** The Strategy Pattern involves defining a group of different algorithm and making it possible to choose and switch between them as needed while a program is running.
  - **Template Method Pattern:** The Template Method is like providing a recipe with some fixed steps (skeleton), but allowing different cooks (subclasses) to add their unique ingredients or flavors (override specific parts) without changing the basic cooking instructions (overall structure).
