# Object Pool

Think of it as a resource manager for reusable items. Imagine a library that lends out books. Instead of buying a new book each time, you check one out and return it when youâ€™re done. The object pool keeps a collection of objects, like database connections or threads, and hands them out when needed. This saves time and resources compared to createing and destroying objects frequently.
