## 做饭

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children at an early age should learn independent living skills.

---

I agree that children should learn independent living skills, such as cooking.

A

> studying overseas, don't worry about

First, cooking is a necessary skill, especially for international students.

When studying overseas, they are often required to cook for themselves.

If students can master this skill in advance, they don't have to worry about the issue of meal preparation, even if they are studying abroad alone.

B

> buying prepared food, avoid high-calorie foods

Moreover, knowing how to cook can prevent students from constantly buying prepared food from restaurants.

When we cook at home, we tend to buy fresh ingredients, avoid high-calorie foods, and maintain our health.

Conversely, relying on prepared food often leads to consuming unhealthy food components.

Therefore, learning independent skills benefits children a lot.
