### 参考案例

1. 综合写作结构句型

   【首段】说明听力和阅读的关系：支持或反对；

   【随后 3 个主体段】把听力的 3 个分论点和阅读的 3 个分论点，依次对比。

   【注意】用听力的分论点对应阅读的分论点，阅读只需写出分论点，不用牵扯太多细节，但听力除了写出分论点，要尽全力补充论据细节。

2. 综合写作建议 225 词-260 词，至少留出 3 分钟检查拼写和语法。

3. 【应试技巧】考试如果听力的细节记不全，答题字数达不到要求，可以最后加个第 5 段：再总结一遍阅读和听力的关系，字数至少达到 225 词。结尾总结参考：

### t1

**The reading passage states that** the problems associated with wind power might hinder the widespread adoption of this renewable energy technology. **However, the professor argues that** there are feasible solutions to these challenges.

**First, the reading claims that** a wind power system requires substantial land. **By contrast, the professor points out that** there are effective strategies to address the land-use issue. **She suggests that** situating wind power systems offshore or on mountaintops can significantly mitigate land-use restrictions, freeing up much land.

**Second, the reading contends that** wind power facilities threaten the lives of birds and bats. **Nonetheless, the professor asserts that** tall structures, not just wind turbines, can threaten flying animals. **She notes that** the primary cause of many bird fatalities in California's wind farms is the outdated designs featuring fast-spinning blades and the placement of some farms in major flyways or close to nesting sites. **She also maintains that** newer designs with slow-moving blades will reduce the number of bird and bat fatalities.

**Finally, the reading reveals that** there are aesthetic issues with wind farms. **Nevertheless, the professor declares that** this problem can be solved by situating the facilities beyond the visual range of residents. **She emphasizes that** current technologies allow for the offshore installation of power systems, remaining out of sight for most locals and alleviating concerns over property values. **Additionally, she underscores that** building wind turbines on mountaintops can avoid negative impacts on residential areas.

### t3

**The reading passage argues that** radio advertising is superior to TV advertising to entice consumers to purchase their products. **However, the professor disagrees with** the views in the reading.

**First, the professor thinks the reading's argument that** radio ads can focus on target customers better **is based on outdated information**. **He claims that** TV programs and advertising tied to mobile phones allow companies to target specific market segments. **He further mentions that** TV stations have developed demographic data for various TV programs, **which can** decide which programs to place the ads in.

**Moreover, the professor questions the reading's statement that** the cost of radio ads is cheaper **and finds the reading inadequate.** **He asserts** that people consider TV ads more believable and hold a higher regard for companies advertising on TV. **He concludes that** TV advertising provides companies with a higher return on investment **because** people tend to talk about the products advertised by those companies.

**Finally, the professor attacks the reading's assertion that** listeners pay more attention to radio ads. **He points out that** radio commercials are "background noise" and radio stations play too much advertising, causing listeners to tune in to other channels or turn off the radio to avoid interference. **Then he says** TV does not have as much of this problem **because** TV programming is generally more engaging and better at attracting viewers' attention.

【应试技巧】考试如果听力的细节记不全，答题字数达不到要求，可以最后加个第 5 段：再总结一遍阅读和听力的关系，字数至少达到 225 词。结尾总结参考：

**In conclusion**, **the professor's counterarguments challenge** the superiority of radio advertising **presented in the reading**. **He questions** its effectiveness in targeting specific markets, **highlights** the higher credibility of TV ads, **and criticizes** the attention-grabbing ability of radio commercials. **These points undermine the claims made in the reading, suggesting that** TV advertising may provide better results.

While I can see the A’s point that some people regard advertising as useless and distracting, I agree with B’s perspective that advertising provide more essential and significant information for consumers to rely on. 

As mentioned by B, consumers have the access to a wide range of descriptions about the products through advertising. In detail, advertisements offer a detailed explanation about a product’s features, outlook and instructions; however, such a wide range of information cannot be approachable if the consumers block advertisements. 

Apart from what B has raised, I add that people can even have negative reviews from advertisements. Demerits of a product will be mentioned in the reviews of the advertising, such as poor battery performance, slow delivery or high frequency maintenance, all of which help consumers arrive at informed decisions; 

on the contrary, well-considered decisions will not be reached without advertising. Therefore, advertising acts as an essential and indispensable source of information for potential consumers.
