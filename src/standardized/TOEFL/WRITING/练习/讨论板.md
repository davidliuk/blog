Andrew presents a compelling argument in favor of promoting student sports activities. 

Admittedly, sports participation is an excellent means to promote students' physical health.

However, considering the responsibilities in promoting academic excellence, I am inclined to prioritize the construction of a new library. In my view, a new library can enhance teaching and scholarly communication. 

A well-equipped library, serving as a platform for academic exchange and cooperation, not only provides access to print books but also offers high-speed internet connectivity and databases for interdisciplinary cooperation.

For example, as cross-disciplinary collaborations continue to increase, both faculty and students in our Software Department require establishing a new library that enhances network across departments, which can provide interdisciplinary research databases. 

Therefore, I firmly believe that constructing a new library, will substantially improve scholarly communication and strengthen our research capabilities.

This week we covered different parenting styles. One idea we discussed was how much independence and freedom we should give our children, especially young children. One related issue is whether there should be an age limit on when children can have mobile phones. 

In this discussion post, I would like you to discuss whether you agree or disagree with the idea of setting a minimum age for when children can have a mobile phone. Explain your perspective.

Andrew:

I totally agree with the idea of not giving children phones before they reach a certain age, let's say ten years or so. l believe children younger than ten are not yet ready to deal with the world that comes with mobile phones, as it can put them in harm's way.

Claire:

Honestly, I am against the idea of restricting mobile phone access for young children. I believe mobile phones can help children communicate with their parents if they need their help for an urgent matter when they are away from their parents at school or else where. Maybe companies can invent a special kind of mobile phone that is some how kid friendly.

In my perspective, it is preferable for children to have an age limit on the use of mobile phones because playing phones excessively exerts a negative impact on children’s health. 

For one thing, because of lacking self-control, they are possibly addicted to games. Staring at the screen for a long time harms their eyesight so that they cannot see many things clearly. Besides, keeping sedentary, kids suffer obesity and are prone to other diseases. 

For another, obviously, children are immature so that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Thus, they are easily influenced by negative information on phones like violent content so as to form a false value. When there are conflicts with other peers, children will fight with them. 

Moreover, if kids spend too much time living in a virtual world, they may become unsociable and eccentric losing the ability to socialize in a normal way, which undermines the relationship with their friends. 

Consequently, there is every reason to believe that limiting a minimum age of owing a mobile phone contributes to the health of kids.

In the next few weeks, we'll be talking about urban traffic management. Let's begin by discussing one popular idea--creating car-free central zones. Some cities around the world have recently designated their downtown areas as being automobile-free which means that vehicles are not allowed to enter the city centers. 

Do you think that more cities should make their central zones car-free? Why and why not?

Claire:

I support the idea of establishing car-free central zones because this will result in one important benefit for city residents-it will be better for their health. Instead of driving everywhere, people will be encouraged to walk or cycle more. It would be a great way to incorporate exercise into people's routines.

Paul:

It sounds like a good idea, but I'm skeptical. My main concern is that many businesses located in the city centers, such as shops and restaurants, may suffer because the customers will no longer be able to reach those businesses by car. For some customers, if they cann't drive, they won't go at all.

范文：

In my perspective, it is preferable promote the relationship with family members and friends by hanging out with them in car-free central zones.

In my perspective, it is preferable to promote the relationship with family members and friends by spending time with them in car-free central zones.

To be more specific, currently, individuals are too occupied with their work, and children also spend most of their time in school, so they just have little time to interact with each other. It’s widely acknowledged that deep communication between parents and children is essential for children’s development, since children feel love and acquire life guide when communicating with parents. By hanging out together, children would have time to share their experience in school with parents and ask for advice to solve the problem they face. Parents get to know more about their children so that they can adjust their parenting methods to get along better with children. 

What’s more, shopping downtown with friends is a popular amusement in car-free zones, like pedestrian malls in cities. They are likely to buy clothes, eat delicious food or participate in some entertainment projects. 

Consequently, More interaction and company strengthen the relationship with friends.

For one thing, because of the fierce competition in society, people constantly feel the pressure of all kinds of work and tasks, so it is of vital importance for people to have some art exhibition to unwind and release their pressure. 

For another, if the government provide support to artists, artists can make more art pieces for the public, which can significantly improve the circumstance of humanity. 

Consequently, there is every reason to believe that providing support to artists contributes to the harmony of society.

Many college students face the overwhelming financial burden of expensive textbooks, which hinders their access to learning materials. In my opinion, a viable solution to this problem is to promote the use of e-books. This approach offers several benefits that can alleviate students' financial strain. Firstly, the internet provides a vast array of books at relatively low prices, enabling students to access a wide range of materials with ease. Additionally, e-books are highly portable, allowing students to carry multiple books in a single device, reducing physical burden and costs. While transitioning to e-books may pose challenges, such as students' preferences for physical textbooks, universities can invest in digital infrastructure and support students in accessing e-books. By embracing digital resources, universities can create a more inclusive and affordable learning environment. In conclusion, promoting the use of e-books is a practical solution that addresses the issue of expensive textbooks and enhances access to educational materials for college students.
