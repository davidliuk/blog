## 教育类

### 1. 不要当学霸

To start with, learning one subject allows students to enhance their study efficiency.

For one thing, it is widely acknowledged that the time for students'learning is precious due to excessive assignments. Obviously, learning one course provides students with more time to focus on their specialized course better, which leads to excellent academic performance. In contrast, taking various classes will occupy most of students' time previewing and reviewing their specialty courses. Under this circumstance, students are more likely to feel exhausted and have little time to complete their assignments in a high quality, which exerts a negative impact on their study efficiency. As a result, they fail to consolidate knowledge they have learned and achieve high grades during final exams.

For another, various subjects, such as some elective courses, have no relation with their major. Being compelled to participate in these classes, students will lose interest in a short period of time. Sleeping in the classes, and chatting with other classmates are not surprising.

Obviously, if students take various classes, their study efficiency will be reduced, and they lose competitive edges when hunting jobs.

---

In addition, specializing in only one subject, students are able to participate in extracurricular activities, which constitutes a stepping stone to improving practical skills.

For one thing, doing physical activities, instead of enrolling in many classes, is essential for students. For instance, via joining a basketball team, students are equipped with teamwork ability, which is an indispensable part of their career development.

What's more, perseverance and diligence can be learned from a fierce basketball competition, In order to win, students have to spare no effort and never give up even if they are tired. During the process of exercising, students possess a robust body, which lays a solid foundation for their busy learning.

For another, if students take only one course, they would have enough time to travel. During a journey, not only could students have a deeper understanding of different culture and history, which broadens their horizons, but also they can encounter different people, and hone their communication skills through interacting deeply.

### 2. 旅游-开拓视野

By virtue of travel, we are capable of broadening our horizons.

To be more specific, we have a thorough understanding of various history and culture in tourist attractions. Actually, only after stepping on tourist attractions in person can one fully immerse himself in its real cultural surroundings that cannot be read from books.

For example, visiting the Statue of Liberty in the USA, we are likely to know American's love and desire of freedom. Also, we have access to different ways of thinking through communicating with local residents from different backgrounds.

What's more, we taste delicious food around the world so as to learn distinctive customs and habits. For instance, plenty of foreigners use knife and fork instead of chopsticks to have dinner. These life experiences brought by traveling would become a part of wealth constituting a stepping stone to the future career.

Consequently, it is worthwhile to travel rather than deposit the money.

### 3. 放松

Traveling is beneficial to relax physically and mentally. Obviously, due to fierce competition in modern society, citizens usually overwork frequently and keep sedentary in the office for a long time, which means they always feel uncomfortable and tired. Therefore, traveling gives them a chance to relax their body by walking out of their office, stretching out their arms and legs and relaxing their muscles. Besides, modern people are always under great pressure from work and life, which renders them stressful. Evidently, traveling with friends or family members is a wise means for them to relieve mental stress. Experiencing beautiful scenery and sharing their worries together are conducive to forgetting troubles and cheering up. As a result, there is every reason to believe that with the aid of traveling, people feel relaxed and refreshed, contributing to health, which is the prerequisite of everything so that the benefits of traveling outweigh those of saving money.

### 4. 一起学学习效率高

be To begin with, by working together students are more motivated forming a constructive study atmosphere. There is no denying that students will encounter various difficulties in studying, which renders them depressed and even deprives confidence in their formative years. Under this circumstance, it is group members who encourage each other to move on in the wake of difficulties. Besides, with the prevalence of electronic products such as Switch and Xbox, many children are addicted to them owing to the lack of self-discipline. They tend to lose interest in studying and thus decrease their study efficiency. However, group members urge them to pay attention to what teachers talk about and finish assignments with high-quality. Hence, there is every reason to believe that learning together contributes to students insisting on study easily.

Meanwhile, working together is beneficial for children to master more solid knowledge and skills. Obviously, there always exist some difficult points in textbooks. If a student tries to understand them merely on his own, he may waste the whole day and it still does not pay off. In contrast, work group enables each one to share relevant information they have got from different sources and their personal perspective. With the aid of those above, they likely catch the essentials easily. Moreover, group discussion also offers a chance to share different learning methods and weigh advantages and disadvantages of them. In this case, they can adjust their original studying methods and grasp more solid knowledge instead of learning them by rote. Besides, learning together is conducive to fostering communicative skill and teamwork, which constitute a stepping stone to their future development.

### 5. 交朋友

Experiencing activities is beneficial for young adults to expand their social networks. Obviously, by means of these activities, juveniles get acquainted with more peers who share similar interest comparing with just an activity. With deep communication and interaction, they may become friends and conduct a harmonious relationship. Therefore, it is possible for them to keep in touch with each other in the daily life and even entertain together to enjoy their life. Spending joyful time together with those who have common interest would help get rid of loneliness and cope with daily pressure.

For one thing, because of lacking self-control, they are possibly addicted to television shows, like cartoons. Staring at the screen for a long time harms their eyesight. Besides, keeping sedentary, kids suffer obesity and are prone to other diseases, leading to poor performance further. For another, obviously, young adults are immature so that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Thus, they are easily influenced by negative information on television like violent and obscene content so as to form a false value. When there are conflicts with other peers, juveniles will fight with them. Moreover, if they spend too much time living in a virtual world, they may become unsociable and eccentric losing the ability to socialize in a normal way, which undermines the relationship with their friends. Consequently, there is every reason to believe that movies and television contributes to health problems of juveniles.

Indulging in computer games gives rise to the decrease of study efficiency for kids. Having a glimpse of the current situation in education, we may marvel at plenty of subjects and homework students must deal with every day, Thus, children ought to devote enough time to previewing in order to have a thorough understanding of difficult points, as well as reviewing and finishing assignments with the purpose of consolidating knowledge. If they waste most of time to play a computer, they have no time to acquire solid knowledge. What's more, without self-discipline, they often stay up late to accomplish the mission in game. As a sleep-deprived person, they are less likely to focus on what teachers talk about because they will fall asleep in class, not to mention mastering class content. Meanwhile, being obsessed with various computer games turns students off subjects in their formative years. Consequently, there is every reason to believe that giving a computer likely contributes to reducing study efficiency.

### 7. 新颗的教学方法

Supposing that a teacher concentrates on lecturing, thus lacking the interaction with students, it is easier for students to feel bored and dull and lose study interest. Hence, they are likely to fall asleep or chat with other classmates in the classroom. In contrast, exchanging ideas among students is a great teaching method to improve their study enthusiasm. Obviously, discussion draws pupils' attention so that they would participate in it actively, including listening carefully and thinking positively, which creates a constructive learning atmosphere in class. Furthermore, it gives teachers more inspiration when they receive students'feedback in class. In this way, teachers make some adjustments in time in order to enhance the quality of teaching. Consequently, there is every reason to believe that discussion renders pupils more motivated and engaged in the class. What's more, discussing and exchanging ideas are really imperative for students in order to master more solid knowledge and skills. For one thing, when students discuss difficult questions and exchange their ideas with each other, they start to consider from different perspectives. Only in this way can these students cope with and comprehend difficult points in study more effectively. Besides, it encourages them to take the initiative to study instead of just accepting teachers'opinions. By comparison, provided that students just take notes, they will be reluctant to analyze and solve problems by themselves gradually. For another, discussion is conducive to enhancing students'teamwork so that they learn how to communicate and cooperate with others, which paves the way for their further development. As a result, it is due to discussion that they could have a command of more knowledge and skills.

### 8. 知识和价值观

In this circumstance, students are more willing to spend time in studying and searching for various kinds of information related to their favorite subjects, hence having a deep and comprehensive understanding of knowledge. Additionally, experienced professors teach students in a more systematic way and know where key points are, thus enhancing students'study efficiency and contributing to mastering their professional knowledge. What's more, professors can teach students more than just knowledge acquired from books. They may teach them practical experience, which is valuable and cannot be gained by students'self-education. Consequently, students will be at an advantage when hunting for jobs in the job market and are more likely to acquire satisfying jobs. Thus, there is every reason to believe that professors are a crucial part in imparting knowledge to students.

In addition, professors are capable of teaching students right values. This is because students are in growth, and they haven't established a mature value system. They tend to imitate virtues from a professor as they consider him as a role model. So professors are supposed to aid students in forming right values. Specifically, students should be polite so that they can leave a more favorable impression on others in this way and have better relationships with others. So next time when they encounter some problems and need some help, other people will be willing to reach out their hands. Apart from that, when some opportunities appear, other people may consider giving the opportunities to someone polite. Furthermore, students ought to be diligent in their study instead of indulging in various computer games like King of Glory because the addiction to such games will occupy a lot of time. As a result, they cannot spare enough time on study and get low grades. What's more, there is excessive violence in computer games. If students cannot distinguish reality from games, they even easily commit crimes. There are many other values like these, so we can see that professors are essential because they can teach students right values.

### 9. 老师和设备

To start with, enhancing teachers'quality is of top priority. For children, their teachers are only authorities, which means teachers are key factors that can improve students scores. If teachers possess excellent abilities, they are more likely to help their students achieve dreams in the future. Schools ought to ask teachers to learn from theoretical courses on the Internet. Especially, it is convenient for them to study online theoretical courses due to the popularity of computers. They will learn famous professors' educational methods by studying online courses. What's more, schools also hold teaching competitions, which allows young teachers to compete with each other and promote with each other. After it, most of young teachers will learn from strengths of others and make up for their weaknesses. As a result, modern educational system pays more attention to quality-oriented education instead of exam-oriented education, so teachers are supposed to learn knowledge about modern education accordingly.

In addition, upgrading school facilities also plays a significant role in improving quality of education. With the development of technology, there are a great number of ways to enhance the quality of education. For one thing, an increasing number of teachers start to utilize multimedia such as PowerPoint. These modern devices enable their students to participate in and focus on classes attentively, since these ways are capable of attracting attention from students. Accordingly, this is a great way to enhance their efficiency. For another, some laboratories are worth establishing due to their functions that are beneficial for students to comprehend theoretical knowledge. The problem today is that students cannot make full use of their theoretical knowledge in the reality. Therefore, laboratories provide them with opportunities so that they put theoretical knowledge into practice, which allows them to better adapt to the modern society and own all-round development. Moreover, students gradually find themselves stuck with a lot of homework and hardly have places and facilities to do sports, so sports equipment is conducive to their exercise even if they can only exercise for a short time. This is a favorable method that makes students feel refreshed and keep physically healthy so that they can absorb more knowledge at the same time. Consequently, these facilities contribute to the ability that quickly blends to modern society and hunts a decent job

For another, having a glimpse of the current situation in people's life standard, it is obvious to find that people now own enough money and are eager to enjoy happiness brought by consuming. After a tight schedule of work, people prefer to buy necessities at an integrated mall closer to their home, for they can save time and energy to have a rest as quickly as possible. However, the former two places are not able to possess such functions. What's more, they often require people to spare more time and unneeded money that is not rational and wise for daily life Consequently, building a shopping mall is more essential than the other two.

### 2. 社会问题

The government enacts new policies to improve employment, which exerts an irreplaceable influence on modern society. Nowadays in China, college students face the grim reality that they would meet fierce competition when they hunt a job after graduation. Although they would make the most of a variety of opportunities and resources to enrich themselves, there are not enough posts to meet so many graduates. Thus, political leaders adopt various measures to improve the situation. For one thing, our political leaders make some policies to encourage government departments and companies to recruit fresh graduates. For another, graduates are offered a variety of opportunities and funds by the government in order to motivate them to start up a business, which benefits them to put what they have learned in the college into practice. Therefore, there is every reason to believe that only with the aid of the government could employment problems be solved finally.

The government bears social responsibility so that it is obliged to protect the environment when people suffer from environmental problems.

The force from an individual or a small group of people may be tiny, but strength from the collective led by the government can be enormous.

The government contributes to popularizing and ensuring health care, which is one of the basic social welfare that can't be relied on individuals. Having a glimpse of current circumstances, a large number of people are having difficulties to receive timely and efficient medical health care. For one thing, market-oriented reform increases the price of certain medicines and advanced technology devices require higher expenses. Thus, the government takes methods to expand health care coverage by establishing social medical insurance that can be afforded by a vast majority of people. Moreover, people are able to enjoy free preventive care and get free checkups annually. Seniors get special discounts on their prescriptions. For another, it is always inconvenient for people to find an adjacent hospital that still has empty beds in emergencies. To solve this problem, the government spares no effort to build community hospitals especially in rural areas and recruit elites who have not only received excellent education but also gained sufficient clinical experience. Consequently, it's widely acknowledged that the help from the government should always be the prior source to seek for.

The government is capable of ensuring social stability and security, generating a harmonious society. Obviously, every country is likely to encounter various problems like economic crisis and natural disaster, which probably leads to social turbulence. Hence, the government not only adopts proper means to deal with them, but also guides citizens to move forward by means of their words and behaviors in order to get through the unpleasant period of time. For example, all of us might still have memories of Wenchuan earthquake in China in 2008. Soon after the earthquake, premier Wen Jiabao not only came to the spot to comfort the local people, but also gave a public speech on television demonstrating that the government would take proper steps to deal with the emergency circumstances, which spurs the whole nation to make concerted efforts to overcome difficulties.

Therefore, the use of clean energy is beneficial to solve air pollution fundamentally.

### 3. 提高环保意识微信

It is also imperative for the government to enhance general consciousness of protecting environment. As the air pollution issue is directly associated with people's daily life, the government ought to encourage them to keep a close watch on it. The government should demand mass media to place public service advertising on newspapers or television programs so as to leave a profound impression on the public. There's no denying that mass media bear tremendous social responsibility of educating people. Moreover, individuals from all walks of life can also be encouraged to make concerted efforts to protect the air condition. The government is supposed to advocate low-carbon life and encourage people to take public transit including subway and bus more frequently in order to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide and other air pollutants.

Also, they can use e-mail to transfer files in a long distance. Hence, it is the improvement of work efficiency that constitutes a stepping stone to their future development in the career.

Additionally, technology contributes a lot to facilitating people's life. To be more specific, nowadays people are under too much pressure from many aspects and just have little time to relax and enjoy. With the inventions of family machines, people are able to relieve themselves from many household chores and therefore have more time to do what they want. For example, dishes washing machines and sweeping machines are commonly used in most of the families. Therefore, people don't need to deal with such chores after long-time work. Moreover, people can make reservations of popular restaurants on their website so as to get dishes at home or save time of waiting in line. Furthermore, with online shops, it's possible to make purchase and wait for the delivery of the products just at home. Accordingly, but for the new technology, by no means can people live with such convenience.

## 七、工作类

### 1. 物质和精神

However, with the widespread of computer, we can't help marveling at the phenomenon that internet has covered all kinds of integrated information of all fields.
