提到教授的举例，时态和原文保持一致。

The reading passage states that the problems associated with wind power might hinder the widespread adoption of this renewable energy technology. However, the professor argues that there are feasible solutions to these challenges.

First, the reading claims that a wind power system requires substantial land. By contrast, the professor points out that there are effective strategies to address the land-use issue. She suggests that situating wind power systems offshore or on mountaintops can significantly mitigate land-use restrictions, freeing up much land.

Second, the reading contends that wind power facilities threaten the lives of birds and bats. Nonetheless, the professor asserts that tall structures, not just wind turbines, can threaten flying animals. She notes that the primary cause of many bird fatalities in California's wind farms is the outdated designs featuring fast-spinning blades and the placement of some farms in major flyways or close to nesting sites. She also maintains that newer designs with slow-moving blades will reduce the number of bird and bat fatalities.

Finally, the reading reveals that there are aesthetic issues with wind farms. Nevertheless, the professor declares that this problem can be solved by situating the facilities beyond the visual range of residents. She emphasizes that current technologies allow for the offshore installation of power systems, remaining out of sight for most locals and alleviating concerns over property values. Additionally, she underscores that building wind turbines on mountaintops can avoid negative impacts on residential areas.

In summary, the professor counters the reading by addressing land use concerns through strategic location choices, suggesting modern turbine designs to lessen the impact on birds and bats, and proposing solutions to aesthetic issues by situating installations out of sight.
