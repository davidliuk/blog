# About Me

I‚Äôm **Dawei Liu**, a graduate student in **Computer and Information Science (CIS)** at the **University of Pennsylvania**, expected to graduate in **May 2026**. I hold a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering** from **Northeastern University (NEU)**.

Currently, I‚Äôm an **SDE Intern at TikTok**, working on the **Commerce Ads team**, where I focus on **recommendation infrastructure** and **performance optimization** for large-scale ads delivery systems. Previously, I interned at **Amazon** and **JD.com**, where I contributed to the distributed systems observability and AI platforms. I was honored to receive **2026 full-time return offers** from both **TikTok and Amazon** for my internship performance.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI infrastructure and systems performance**, and I‚Äôm passionate about solving large-scale engineering problems that demand both **scalability and efficiency**.

## üíº Professional Experience

### üîπ TikTok ‚Äì SDE Intern, Commerce Ads, May - Dec 2025

At TikTok, I focused on building **scalable and fault-tolerant recommendation infrastructure** for Commerce Ads. I designed and optimized systems to support **high-throughput, low-latency Ads delivery**, including a debugging and verfication framework for new ad formats, cache restructuring that improved stability under heavy traffic, and real-time Flink features for ranking and creative selection. My work directly enhanced the platform‚Äôs **resilience, efficiency, and rollout velocity** at global scale.

### üîπ Amazon ‚Äì SDE Intern, Global Mile, June - Sep 2024

At Amazon, I developed a **custom Java Agent** to extend OpenTelemetry‚Äôs tracing, enabling **end-to-end observability** across distributed microservices and Lambda environments. I built full-stack tools for trace visualization and implemented a **Loosely Link module** that logically connected services without direct invocations. By improving **traceability, reliability, and developer tooling**, I enhanced the debugging and monitoring experience for complex distributed systems.

### üîπ JD.com ‚Äì SDE Intern, Algorithm Tools, Jul - Oct 2023

At JD.com, I worked on platform engineering for internal AI tooling. I redesigned a **resource management service** using Kubernetes' `Informer` + observer pattern, reducing start-up time by 20x. I introduced **GitOps + Argo Workflows** for cloud-native CI/CD, built Helm charts for privatized deployments, and improved code modularity for activity page generation using **AIGC pipelines**. My work enabled faster and more maintainable delivery of algorithmic components.
