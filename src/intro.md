# About Me

Hi! I’m David Liu, a passionate software engineer with a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU) and currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).

My academic interests lie in computer graphics, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence, where I enjoy bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications. I’ve had the privilege of interning at JD.com and Amazon, where I gained valuable experience in software development and project management.

Through this blog, I share my learning experiences, project highlights, and technical explorations. I hope to connect with like-minded individuals and grow together as we navigate the ever-evolving world of technology!
