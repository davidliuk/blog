## 👋 About Me

I'm **Dawei Liu**, a first year master student in **Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT)** at the **University of Pennsylvania**. I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** from **Northeastern University (NEU)**.

Currently, I’m an **SDE Intern at TikTok**, working on the **Commerce Ads team**, where I focus on **recommendation infrastructure** and **performance optimization** for large-scale machine learning serving systems. Previously, I interned at **Amazon** and **JD.com**, where I contributed to the distributed systems observability and AI platforms.

While my academic focus is in **computer graphics**—from auto-rigging to interactive systems—I also love digging into **infra**, **systems performance**, and **ML deployment**. I thrive at the intersection of **graphics**, **AI**, and **systems engineering**.

## 💼 Internship Highlights

### 🔹 TikTok – SDE Intern, Commerce Ads (2025)

At TikTok, I work on the **recommendation infrastructure** that powers Commerce Ads delivery. My contributions focus on building **high-throughput, low-latency serving systems** for ad ranking and model execution. This involves optimizing real-time inference, load balancing, and user experience protection under high QPS. I also participate in designing new ad products with infra that ensures **scalability and fault tolerance** at global scale.

### 🔹 Amazon – SDE Intern, Global Mile (2024)

During my internship at Amazon, I developed a **custom Java Agent** to extend OpenTelemetry’s tracing capabilities. By using **ByteBuddy**, I instrumented annotated methods for payload introspection and built a **full-stack visualization platform**—including timelines, tree plots, and fuzzy-search UI for end-to-end trace data. I also engineered a “Loosely Link” module to logically connect microservices via business IDs, enhancing **traceability in distributed Lambda environments**.

### 🔹 JD.com – SDE Intern, Algorithm Tools (2023)

At JD.com, I worked on platform engineering for internal AI tooling. I redesigned a **resource management service** using Kubernetes' `Informer` + observer pattern, reducing start-up time by 20x. I introduced **GitOps + Argo Workflows** for cloud-native CI/CD, built Helm charts for privatized deployments, and improved code modularity for activity page generation using **AIGC pipelines**. My work enabled faster and more maintainable delivery of algorithmic components.
