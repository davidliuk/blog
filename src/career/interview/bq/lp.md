Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a clients expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation? （没有满足客户期望，你怎么改善？）

Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities. （缺少清晰职责的项目）

3. Invent and Simplify (创新和简化）

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by not invented here. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

6. Hire and Develope The Best (招聘和培养最好的人才）

Leaders have relentlessly high standards many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered. （工作超出项目范围，并带来好的结果）

9. Bias for Action (行动为王）

Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources. （有限时间和资源）

11. Earn Trust (赢得信任）

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their teams body odour smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing? （最好的公司朋友偷窃，你怎么办）

Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth. （怎么告诉别人严酷的事实）

12. Deep Dive （深入理解）

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.

13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit (勇气，敢于说出不同意见，并服从大局）
