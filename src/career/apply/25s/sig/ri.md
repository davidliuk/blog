You’ll speak with a SIG recruiter about your experience, interest in the role, technical acumen, and what you’re looking for in your next opportunity. 

This interview is your introduction to SIG and our opportunity to learn more about you and your experience as you look to take the next step in your career. During this conversation, we’ll ask questions about your education, past experiences, and projects. 

We’re especially interested in hearing about projects that demonstrate business impact or times you’ve implemented robust technical solutions. We’re also looking for candidates who are passionate about technology, learning, and problem solving, so we encourage you to let that shine through! The recruiter will also give an overview of the interview process and answer any questions you may have about the role or SIG. 

Tips for success: 

- Practice talking through your resume and explaining your experiences to a friend or a peer, so you can feel comfortable and confident on interview day. 
- When discussing a project or task, your response should include specific details such as your approach, overall results, and its significance. 
- Avoid “we” statements whenever possible- we love collaboration at SIG, but we want to learn about what you worked on and your individual contributions. 
- Find a quiet place for the call with minimal distractions.
