If you receive a Windows laptop, you will require use of a personal computer for approximately 20 minutes to register your security key on your first day. If you do not have a personal computer, please arrange to borrow one or visit your local library to use a public computer to register your security key. 

If you receive a MacBook, you will not need to use a personal computer to set up your security key. Instructions to register your security key and how to access the Amazon network will be sent to your personal e-mail address.

In the rare case you believe you need different IT equipment than the options below, please proceed by completing this form selecting the best option available. Once submitted, email your manager explaining why you need a different laptop. Your manager will then request an override if applicable.

You will receive a backpack, laptop, two security keys, and a headset. Based on your local IT policy, you may also receive a monitor and mouse.
