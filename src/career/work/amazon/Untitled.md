Few things are more crucial to Amazon's success than its people. Amazonians are the builders, the creators, and the suppliers that enable smiles to be delivered, industries to be disrupted, and customers to be delighted. We are always looking for people who will raise the bar – and who knows if someone embodies our [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/principles) better than those who’ve worked at Amazon? We appreciate you spending time with Amazon over the course of your internship. We’d like to also get to know your peers on campus. You can submit referrals to Amazon internships or full-time roles for recent graduates [here](https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/business_categories/student-programs).
