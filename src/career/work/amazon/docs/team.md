Onboarding plan

请加根manager说一声，然后系统里面怎么样，然后就不需要打卡了

There are three main phases in your internship - 

- onboarding, 
- midpoint, 
- final evaluation.

---

During the internship, your manager will evaluate your performance twice. The first is an informal evaluation partway through your internship. In most cases, this is at the halfway point, or the midpoint, although longer internships may have multiple checkpoints at set intervals. 


You and your manager will discuss your project progress, performance, and how to ensure success in the internship's next phase. Your tasks will include:

    Set-up midpoint review with your manager
    Checking in with your mentor to get their feedback
    After midpoint, start preparing for your final evaluation
