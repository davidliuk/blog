Dear Interns,
 
Congratulations on reaching the halfway mark of your internship! Your midpoint date is as below, and there will be a midpoint evaluation discussion scheduled by your manager shortly.
 
Midpoint Date: 7/24/2024
Meeting Date: To be scheduled by Intern Manager, within a 4 day window of the Midpoint date
Meeting Stakeholders: Intern Manager, Intern, Mentor, and any other stakeholders who have insight into intern performance
 

Preparing for Midpoint:
Confirm that your midpoint evaluation discussion is scheduled. If not, connect with your manager to schedule.
Complete Intern Evaluation and Exit Training. Although this training is geared toward the final evaluation, it will help you understand what and why we evaluate and allow you to discuss the final evaluation with your manager well ahead of time. Use the internship evaluation criteria (below) as your starting point to understand more about your midpoint evaluation (Reminder: midpoint review is like a “practice run” for your final evaluation process) :
 Review the Role Guidelines for your role. Note: If you do not see a guideline listed for your particular role, use the General Leveling Guideline.
Review the Amazon Leadership Principles and the Insider's Guide to the LPs to understand what "good" looks like for each of the LPs.
Review your specific project plan, and evaluate your progress against key milestones and deliverables.
Reflect on coaching and feedback you've received and how you were able to take action.
Next, complete the Midpoint Intern Self-Review Template to help you prepare; this form is optional but highly recommended. Download by clicking on "Actions," then "Download." Fill out to guide what you'll share and discuss with your manager.
Reference the Intern Conversation Guide - Midpoint as an optional resource to help you prepare and engage in the conversation
 
During the Midpoint:
During the meeting, be sure to take notes! The midpoint discussion will include a general evaluation of your progress thus far in your internship. The midpoint discussion will include:
Progress updates on the work you've done toward your project deliverables.
Discussion of roadblocks or dependencies which may impact your project delivery.
Calibration on Leadership Principles strengths and growth opportunities.
Development of an action plan and next steps, based on feedback your manager provides.
Questions you have about the final evaluation process
Feedback from your manager, mentor, and you.
After the Midpoint: Consider how to incorporate this for success in the second half of your internship.
Create an action plan. We have an optional action plan template you can download and customize.
Review any action items and next steps.
Incorporate feedback into your project plan (e.g., if you agreed to adjust a deliverable date, make sure you've captured this).
Plan to provide updates in future 1:1s with your manager.
Take the Intern Midpoint survey (sent from Qualtrics). This survey will be sent to you within one week of the midpoint.
