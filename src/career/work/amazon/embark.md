## Intro

Hi! I'm Saanvi. I graduated from Penn State in May with a bachelor's in Computer Science. Excited to start my first "real" job as an AWS full-stack engineer! (Not counting the four years I worked as a Starbucks barista while in college, haha!)

When I'm not at work I like to read (any other historical fiction fans out there?) and go for hikes with my dog, Kiki.

Hi! I'm Dawei Liu. I am currently a senior student from Northeastern University, and am going the take my master degree at the University of Pennsylvania. I am excited to start my summer internship as an Software Development Engineer.

Hi! I am Dawei Liu, and I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University, finishing my bachelor's degree. I'm excited to share that I'll soon be starting my master's program at the University of Pennsylvania. This summer, I'm thrilled to join Amazon as a Software Development Engineer intern.

In my free time, I love playing a mobile game called "Brawl Stars" by Supercell; I've been playing it since it launched in China. During the winter, I enjoy skiing and ice skating, which are some fun activities I picked up while studying in the Northeast. I even took an alpine skiing course as part of my physical education in my freshman year. I also have a wonderful girlfriend of four years, and we plan to pursue further studies together in the United States.

Before joining Amazon, I interned at JD.com last year as a backend developer. There, I gained valuable experience in enterprise development practices and standards, which has greatly shaped my skills and prepared me for this exciting new journey with Amazon.

I'm really looking forward to meeting and working with all of you. Let's make this summer a memorable one!

Best,
[Your Name]

In my free time, I love playing a mobile game called "Brawl Stars" by Supercell; I've been hooked since it launched in China. During the winter, I enjoy amateur skiing and ice skating, which I picked up while studying in the Northeast. Fun fact: I even took an alpine skiing course as part of my physical education in my freshman year. I also have a wonderful girlfriend of four years, and we plan to pursue further studies together in the United States.

Last year, I interned at JD.com as a backend SDE, where I gained valuable experience in enterprise development practices and standards, which has greatly shaped my skills and prepared me for this exciting new journey with Amazon.

Looking forward to meeting you all!
