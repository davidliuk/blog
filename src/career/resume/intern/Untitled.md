I’m pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science (CGGT) at the University of Pennsylvania, following a solid foundation in software engineering from my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University. Through internships at Amazon and JD.com, I’ve gained extensive experience in both backend and frontend development. I’ve worked with technologies like Java, Elasticsearch, and OpenTelemetry to build scalable systems, including a comprehensive tracing platform with a Java agent, backend services, and a frontend interface for enhanced observability. My focus has consistently been on developing robust, high-performance systems.
