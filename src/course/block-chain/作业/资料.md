目前还有第一个part需要一位同学来认领，然后另外一位同学可以视情况做一些整体善后的工作啦，或者如果两位同学

There are different types of authenticated data structures in blockchain, such as **digital signatures** and **digital watermarking**⁴. 

Digital signatures are a secure form of authentication where trust can be anchored on the digital signature of both parties⁴. Digital watermarking is a form of data origin authentication that gives data source authentication without any need to access the source data⁴.

Some examples of blockchain authentication include personal identity: user authentication and data protection, financial transactions, luxury, supply chain, food industry, and more¹. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

I'm sorry but I couldn't find a top-level paper on the literature review of the latest blockchain authentication data structure. However, I found some papers that might be of interest to you. 

Based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature, this paper presents a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management, and establishes key themes, trends and emerging areas for research¹. 

Another paper aims to identify and analyze peer-reviewed literature that seeks to use Blockchain smart contracts for securing the Internet in general and the Internet of Things in particular and presents the systematic analysis of the identified literature³.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
