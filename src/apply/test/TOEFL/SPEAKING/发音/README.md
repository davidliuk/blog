# 发音

【低分原因】90%的口语低分，都是因为发音无法达到Clear评分要求：考官听不懂考生“咕哝”啥，内容评分只会更低。

【解决原理】先学走再学跑，慢速跟读最有效：先放慢语速纠音，清晰Clear让考官听懂，然后再慢慢提速。

【纠音作业】先看着文本，听一遍美语母语慢速录音，再跟读校对5遍——不苛求达到母语，但求Clear让考官听懂！

### Day 1

① I agree that children should learn independent living skills, such as cooking.

② First, cooking is a necessary skill, especially for international students.

③ When studying overseas, they are often required to cook for themselves.

④ If students can master this skill in advance, they don't have to worry about the issue of meal preparation, even if they are studying abroad alone.

⑤ Moreover, knowing how to cook can prevent students from constantly buying prepared food from restaurants.

⑥ When we cook at home, we tend to buy fresh ingredients, avoid high-calorie foods, and maintain our health. 

⑦ Conversely, relying on prepared food often leads to consuming unhealthy food components.

⑧ Therefore, learning independent skills benefits children a lot.

### Day 2

① I think a place to live should be convenient for commuting.

② At least for me, it will be valuable if a house has easy access to the subway.

③ Taking the subway is a great way to save time.

④ In my city, traffic jams are serious, so driving to commute carries the risk of being late.

⑤ However, taking the subway can save time on the journey to one's destination, and one can use the time on the subway to study and work.

⑥ For example, recently, I have been busy working and preparing for an English test, so I utilized the time on the subway to memorize words.
