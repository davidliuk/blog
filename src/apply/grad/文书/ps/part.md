## Why

**Deep Technical Knowledge**
"I definitely increased the depth of my security knowledge through courses at CMU. This profound knowledge helped me in moving to a tech lead role for an application security project within less than two years at Amazon."

– Manideep Konakandla, Senior Security Engineer and Tech Lead, Amazon

**An Interdisciplinary Perspective** 
"Exposure to both engineering and business helped to form principles that became my framework working in the industry. How INI bridged these two different worlds was the most valuable part."

– Yen-Ming Chen, Program Manager at Apple 

**Strong Network and Connections**
"I came to CMU right after my undergrad, so my time and experience at the INI was the foundation for beginning my career. Today, networking is a breeze, and it's great to see that there is usually an INI alum as a mutual connection with most people in the tech industry."

– Devika Yeragudipati, Security Engineer, Apple Media Services
