**1. Strong Candidacy and Unique Qualities**

As a candidate for the INI program at CMU, I believe my unique blend of academic excellence, competitive success, and practical experience sets me apart. My academic journey at Northeastern University, evidenced by a GPA of 3.94, reflects not only my intellectual prowess but also my dedication to the field of software engineering. Beyond the classroom, I have actively engaged in software development contests, securing the first prize at the ByteDance Youth Camp and emerging as a finalist in the Apple Mobile Application Innovation Contest. These achievements in competitive environments showcase my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges and innovate under pressure.

Moreover, my internship at Jingdong, a leading e-commerce giant in China, has given me hands-on experience in a fast-paced, innovation-driven industry. Here, I developed key services such as a resource management service and an AI activity page auto-generate service, demonstrating my ability to contribute significantly to large-scale, impactful projects.

**2. Preparation for Graduate Studies**

My preparation for graduate studies at the INI is rooted in a comprehensive educational background and diverse professional experiences. My coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms, Human-Computer Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence has provided a strong theoretical foundation and stimulated my interest in the potential applications of AI in software development.

My participation in prestigious software development contests has prepared me for the rigors and collaborative nature of graduate study. Winning the ByteDance Youth Camp and being a finalist in the Apple contest have honed my skills in innovation and problem-solving, key competencies for success in graduate studies.

My professional experience at Jingdong offered me an invaluable insight into the practical applications of software engineering principles in a real-world business context. Managing significant projects and navigating the challenges of a dynamic corporate environment has prepared me for the collaborative and research-intensive nature of graduate studies.

**3. Overcoming Challenges in a Team Setting**

During my internship at Jingdong, I faced a significant challenge while developing the AI activity page auto-generate service. The project required integrating AI algorithms with the existing e-commerce platform, a task that involved coordinating with various teams and managing complex technical requirements.

The initial phase of the project was fraught with communication breakdowns and technical hurdles. I took the initiative to facilitate better communication by organizing regular cross-departmental meetings, ensuring all teams were aligned on project goals and progress. I also dedicated extra time to research and propose innovative solutions to technical challenges, which were eventually implemented successfully.

This experience taught me the importance of proactive communication, collaboration, and perseverance in overcoming challenges in a team setting, skills that I believe will be invaluable in graduate studies.

**4. Contributing to CMU’s Values**

My experiences have shaped me into a person who deeply resonates with CMU's values of excellence, innovation, integrity, and respect for diversity. My academic record exemplifies my commitment to excellence, while my participation in software development contests reflects my passion for innovation.

In terms of being genuine and respectful, I have always strived to maintain authenticity in my interactions and respect diverse viewpoints, a practice I honed during my team-based projects at Jingdong. I believe that embracing diversity of thought and background fosters creativity and leads to more robust solutions.

My commitment to integrity and trustworthiness has been a cornerstone of my academic and professional life. I have always upheld the highest ethical standards in my work and collaborations, ensuring transparency and honesty in all my endeavors.

At CMU, I aim to contribute to these values by bringing my unique perspectives, fostering an inclusive environment, and upholding the high standards of integrity and excellence that define the university.
