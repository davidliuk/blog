记得地里有帖子曾经说过PS的重要性，特别是对我这种硬件很弱的人来说，尤为重要。首先，硬件已经没有办法弥补了；其次陶瓷如同赌博，不一定管用。那么PS和CV就是你区别于其他申请者的重要文件了。

写PS的过程是一个很漫长的过程，不要怕推倒重写，每一次重写都是进步。个人的几条总结经验：

(1)PS这种文档，仁者见仁，智者见智，没有统一的格式和标准，要根据自己的实际情况写。

见过申请MIT的牛人的PS，写清楚一个项目和自己的论文，就足够了。LZ比较悲催，没有任何牛的经历，勉强有篇IEEE的英文会议论文充门面。所以从一开始，我就没准备粉饰和包装自己，老老实实写清楚自己干了什么，对专业的看法，对什么感兴趣，为什么要申请。过度的包装很容易在后来的面试中露出马脚，得不偿失。

(2)PS不可能把你的全部经历写清楚，弱水三千一瓢也够了，取舍才能彰显个人特色。

个人认为从大学开始写起就足够了，把触发你兴趣，提升你能力，引发你思考的重要事情，作为里程碑写清楚。一般有两种观点，一种说PS里面尽量少说细节，多说你的心路历程;一种有的说是要突出你的专业能力，独立思考，特别是项目经验。个人认为，作为申请CS的同学，还是老老实实以项目为基础写，在适当的地方突出你对专业的热情，坚持和独特的见解。理由主要有二：

1. PS算是半个陶瓷，是体现你能力的重要文件，CV只能简写，你在PS里面怎么能不突出项目经验呢？
2. CS的学生，没有任何项目经验就对CS产生了浓厚的感兴趣了，说出去谁信啊？美国人的思维是：我对xx感兴趣是因为我作了xx。他们相信事实的支撑而不是优雅的文笔。

(3)开篇就点醒你的兴趣方向，不要让老美自己去分析，或者在你PS的xx段的第几行去发现。

通常看了开头，委员会就能很快找到适合看你PS的教授了。兴趣方向可以根据你申请的学校略作修改，因为不同学校，专业方向的名称略有不同。比如有学校多机器人方向可能叫multi-agent system，有的会叫multi-robot system.

(4)虽然有第（2）点的说明，但是注意PS不是研究报告，也不是科普，你的研究细节要深入浅出地说。
你PS的每一句话，包括谈你的项目经验都是为了回答这以下问题中的某一个或几个：

1. 你的研究兴趣是什么
2. 你是如何产生兴趣的，并且为这个兴趣付出了什么
3. 你在你的兴趣方向取得了什么样成绩
4. 为什么要继续你的研究，什么事情触发了你的念头
5. 为什么选择某某university
6. 因为你有什么特别之处，某某大学因此要录取你

基于这些问题仔细琢磨你的每一个版本的PS，如果不能回答这些关键问题，或者和这些问题无关，就可能是：

1) 废话
2) 你的主线但是你表达不清楚;
3) 你的支线经历。

PS的最终目的是让你独特，并且让你和你申请的大学match。独特不能保证你被录取，match也不能保证。两者都有，概率才会变大。

(5)把你的PS当做一次面试底稿来准备。例如（英语水平有限，大家看个意思就行）：

你在这种虚拟面试里面说过的话串起来就是一篇不错的PS初稿。反反复复做这种面试，会有不一样的效果。

也就是说，PS里面的问题，其实也就是面试的问题，写清楚了PS，面试其实就准备了一大半。然后大家就可以明白为什么要大胆删除你的支线了，你会在面试中，和教授聊一个
他完全不清楚的项目么？同样，不要花大的篇幅写和你主流兴趣无关的内容，如果你想通过一些实例表现你的激情，坚持，独特见解，要么接合你的主流项目体现。要么简略写写。

(6)PS和CV是相辅相承的，PS里面你砍掉的重要支线都可以在CV里体现。

PS里面，项目是骨架，你的兴趣，动力和思想是精神。不是写的越长，项目越多就越好。所以PS里无关的内容大胆砍掉，心疼就放到CV里面。例如你有学生会的经验，有组织大型活动的经验，ok，除非你能把你的这些经历和你的研究兴趣扯上关系，我建议最好还是放到你的CV里面。记得曾经有帖子谈PS，作者写到他在组织班级活动的时候，领悟到了操作系统的调度原理。那么好吧，这是非常独特的一篇PS，LZ膜拜。

暂时总结这些，LZ写东西和写笔记一样，想起来就写一堆，以后还有经验想起会继续补充。希望这些想法对大家有参考价值。

**Question 1** - The Brown CS master's degree program is organized around a set of "Pathways" that cover the wide range of topics offered for study. Upon entering the program, you will choose a Pathway to guide your course selections leading to graduation. The courses you take will be drawn from those listed for your chosen Pathway and other areas of study. For this question, please read the Pathway descriptions found here. Then make a preliminary selection of a Pathway (you do not need to choose individual courses at this time) and indicate your choice in the list below. The Pathway you choose now does not commit you to follow it should you join the Brown program.*

In the box below explain how your undergraduate study has prepared you to do the coursework for your chosen Pathway. You may describe the courses you have taken as an undergraduate and how you believe they will support your studies at Brown. A later question will ask about any research experience you have had, so don't include that in your answer here.*
