Personal Statement for Application to CMU MSCS Program

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have cultivated a strong academic background in software engineering at Northeast University, with an average score of 92.8 and a GPA of 3.955, ranking fifth out of 396 students in my major. This solid foundation has equipped me with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue further studies in computer science.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have actively participated in various competitions, showcasing my leadership and teamwork abilities. One notable accomplishment was leading a team to develop an innovative mobile application, which won first place in the regional round of the Apple Mobile App Innovation Competition and achieved second place in the finals among 1690 participating teams. Furthermore, I received the first prize in the ByteDance Training Camp for my contribution to a social recommendation algorithm knowledge sharing platform. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a passion for pushing the boundaries of innovation.

During my internships, I had the opportunity to work as a backend development engineer at JD.com and AI Growth Camp (AIGC). At JD.com, I contributed to the reconstruction of the resource management service in the AI development computing platform. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of backend development and its role in supporting efficient AI systems. Similarly, at AIGC, I played a key role in revamping the AI page generation service in the marketing growth platform. These internships have provided me with hands-on experience in developing scalable and efficient solutions, further fueling my desire to excel in the field of computer science.

Looking ahead, my career goals are divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives. In the short term, I aim to deepen my knowledge in backend development and secure a position as a backend engineer at renowned companies like Apple. This will allow me to work on cutting-edge technologies and contribute to the development of innovative solutions. In the medium term, I aspire to enhance my system design skills and gain project management experience within large enterprises. My ultimate goal is to become an architect and a technical leader, driving technological advancements and leading teams to success. In the long term, I envision establishing an AI-driven marketing growth company and becoming a unicorn in the industry, leveraging the power of AI to revolutionize marketing strategies.

With its renowned faculty, cutting-edge research opportunities, and vibrant academic community, CMU's MSCS program aligns perfectly with my academic background, career aspirations, and passion for innovation. I am confident that pursuing my master's degree at CMU will provide me with the necessary skills, knowledge, and network to achieve my goals.
