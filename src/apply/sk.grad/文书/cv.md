## WORKING EXPERIENCE

### JD.com

- Yanxi AI development and computing platform.
- Refactored the resource management services by implementing ConfigMap for automated and configurable machine resource splitting solutions. 
- Utilized the Kubernetes Informer mechanism, along with observer pattern, asynchronous processing, row locking, and discard policies, to significantly improve the efficiency of platform resource margin calculation and achieve a 20x faster service startup speed. 
- Optimized the CI/CD toolchain by implementing cloud-native CI workflows using Argo Workflows. Leveraged GitOps to trigger Argo CD for continuous deployment. 
- Participated in the privatization deployment project for China Construction Bank (CCB) by building Helm charts to enable platform privatization deployment capabilities. 
- Took responsibility for refactoring the activity page generation service for the AI-pilot Marketing platform, enhancing code structure and improving code reusability by implementing the strategy pattern.

## ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE

### Trace Note

- An augmented reality social application based on location. Users can place notes in nearby scenes to share their experiences and earn tokens through consecutive check-ins for personalized items. 

- Implemented AOP to validate user login status and permissions using annotations. Utilized Redis for distributed session management, resolving login synchronization issues across clusters. 
- Implemented the template pattern to create a generic cache access static method, effectively addressing cache avalanche, cache penetration, and cache breakdown issues. 
- Stored nearby traces using Redis' Geo data structure and utilized Geo Search commands for high-performance trace queries and distance-based sorting. 
- Implemented user following and mutual following features using Redis Set data structure, ensuring data persistence with Redis AOF. 
- Used Lua scripts to perform inventory pre-checks for accessories, preventing overselling and enabling one order per person. Employed RabbitMQ for asynchronous order creation and timeout-based order cancellation.
