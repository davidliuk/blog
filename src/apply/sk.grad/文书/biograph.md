### Internship

#### JD.com

Refactored the resource management service by implementing ConfigMap for automated and configurable resource-splitting solutions.
 Utilized the Kubernetes Informer mechanism, along with observer pattern, asynchronous processing, row locking, and discard policies, to significantly improve the efficiency of platform resource recalculation and achieve a 20x faster service startup speed.
 Optimized the CI/CD toolchain with cloud-native CI workflows using Argo Workflows and GitOps to trigger Argo CD.
 Participated in the privatization deployment project for China Construction Bank (CCB) by building Helm charts to enable platform privatization deployment capabilities.
 Refactored the activity page generation service for the AI-pilot Marketing platform, enhancing code structure and improving reusability by implementing the strategy pattern. Designed generation pipelines with AIGC services to generate activity content floors effectively.

### Research

#### Bioinformatics Data Visualization

Contributed to the development of a bioinformatics data visualization platform, using the OViz framework to create diverse bioinformatics charts for the TIMEDB website. More details about the TIMEDB project can be found on the TIMEDB website.

Conducted data structuring, cleaning, and analysis, ensuring data quality and usability.

Developed user-friendly interfaces using Vue, enhancing data accessibility and user interaction.

Published contributions in "Nuclear Acid Research" (IF: 19.160/Q1). Details at https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance- article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkac1006/6833242.

#### Cloud-Based Game Experience

Analyzed network performance, frame rates, resolution, and related data in cloud gaming. Explored factors impacting cloud gaming quality. 

Utilized Python (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) for data analysis and Vue.js with ECharts for further visualization.

### Teaching Experience

Secretary Academic Planning Center

Served as a lecturer for advanced mathematics during the winter academic support program and provided online study session assistance. 

Orchestrated the planning of the spring semester academic support program, including drafting event proposals and promotional materials, and recruiting academic workshop instructors and volunteers.

Helped 400+ peers improve academic performance, leading to significant quiz score improvements.

### Awards

ByteDance Youth Camp First Prize, 2022/09/30, ByteDance

Mobile Application Innovation Contest Regional First Prize, 2022/08/01, Apple Inc.

Mobile Application Innovation Contest Second prize in the finals, 2022/09/10, Apple Inc.

In the 2022 Apple Mobile Application Innovation Contest, I led my team to secure the national second prize with our project "Trace Note," an AR social platform. This application allowed users to share experiences by placing virtual notes in real-world scenes and earn tokens. I implemented Aspect-Oriented Programming for user authentication and used Redis for distributed session management. I also developed a versatile cache tool class to address various cache-related issues, employed Redis Geo for efficient trace queries, and utilized RabbitMQ to implement the order-related features.

At the 4th ByteDance Youth Camp, as a team leader, I steered our project "Juejin" to win the first prize. We built a personalized social recommendation system using the TrustSVD algorithm, effectively mitigating the cold start problem with users' social connections. I developed the micro-service backend system. My role included implementing Spring Scheduler for daily recalculations of recommendation data and using Redisson for distributed locks, ensuring accurate and efficient recommendations.
