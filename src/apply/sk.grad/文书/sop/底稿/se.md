In a world driven by rapid technological advancements, my aspiration is to be at the forefront of system development, intertwining the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering. My academic journey and professional experiences have paved a strong foundation in AI, and I am now eager to advance my expertise through the Master of Computer Science program at UCSD.

My academic excellence was first established at Northeastern University, where I pursued a degree in Software Engineering, achieving an impressive GPA of 3.955. Here, I was awarded the National Scholarship and recognized as an Outstanding Student Pacesetter. Courses like Big Data Technology and Introduction to AI not only piqued my interest in AI but also steered me towards the nuances of system development.

My professional journey began with a pivotal role at JD.com, a Fortune 500 tech giant. Here, I restructured the resource management service of the Yanxi AI Develop & Computing Platform, enhancing its efficiency and scalability. This task required a deep understanding of system architecture, which I applied by implementing the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing. This experience not only honed my skills in AI but also in optimizing and developing robust systems.

Further, my participation in the AI Pilot Marketing Platform project involved refactoring the activity page generation service and collaborating with machine learning engineers. This role expanded my understanding of AI-driven software solutions and user-centered design, reinforcing my desire to delve deeper into system development.

Outside my professional roles, my leadership in the development of 'Juejin' and 'Trace Note' allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. In the 'Juejin' project, my team and I developed a personalized social recommendation system using the TrustSVD algorithm. This experience was not just about implementing an advanced AI algorithm; it was about creating a system that could adapt to user preferences, mitigate information overload, and address the cold start problem prevalent in recommendation systems. We used Spring Scheduler for daily recalculations of recommendation data and Redisson for distributed locks, ensuring efficient and accurate system performance.

The 'Trace Note' project, an AR social platform, required a different set of skills. Here, I led the team to develop a system where users could interact with their environment in a novel way. We implemented Aspect-Oriented Programming for user authentication, employed Redis for session management, and utilized Redis Geo for high-speed trace queries. This project not only tested my technical skills but also my ability to envision and execute a user-friendly application.

Looking forward, my immediate goal is to join a company with cutting-edge AI products, like Google or Meta, where I can contribute to the lifecycle of AI-driven products. In the long run, I aspire to start my own AI company, leveraging my system development expertise to revolutionize workflows and enhance daily life.

UCSD's MSCS program, with its balanced approach to theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, is the ideal environment for my growth. I am particularly excited about courses like Advanced Operating Systems and Distributed Systems, which will equip me with the knowledge and skills essential for a career in system development. At UCSD, I aim to immerse myself in a learning environment that fosters innovation and practical application, allowing me to evolve as a software engineer and system developer.

I am confident that my background in AI, combined with the knowledge and experiences I will gain at UCSD, will prepare me to make significant contributions to the tech industry.
