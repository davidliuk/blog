# Letter of Recommendation

Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (Buckley Amendment)

一定要waive查看推荐信的权利，否则committee就不看这封信了，而且几乎不可能录取你了

“in what capacity“ 是指推荐人熟悉你的程度和时间，如very　familiar，three　years。

在推荐表的 "in what capacity" 一栏中，您应该填写您与推荐人的关系或者您在与推荐人互动时所处的职位或角色。这一栏的目的是让读者了解您是以什么身份认识并评估被推荐人的。

实际上问的就是你的推荐人在什么情况下(工作，职位，等等)了解你的。 

就是写推荐信的人是如何认识你的，对你了解到什么程度。也就是这封推荐信的可信度如何。

He was a student when I taught ...； 

He did a project with me last year... 

He did a final thesis under my supervision... 

只要不写he is my son, nephew, brother, etc...就可以。

关于weakness，有很多选择，比如(选两个我看过的)： 

1. too focused
2. lack knowledge of marketing, finance, etc.

### 教程

Reference [原文](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-25085-1-1.html)

1. 被推荐人的全名。

2. 推荐人和被推荐人的关系

  i.e., 推荐人是如何认识被推荐人的，认识了多久，有多了解。

  比如大一的时候此人就上过我的课，之后又跟我做过project；此人上我课的时候每周都会在office hour和我交流，还做过我的grader assistant；此人在我手下实习了三个月，表现不错。

3. 推荐人认为被推荐人具有的优点，并且有details支持。

  例如此人很勤奋，在跟我做的一个 project 上花了很多时间，我前一天布置的xyz任务他通宵了一晚上以后第二天就交给我了，而类似的任务给其他人可能要一个星期以后才能给我。此人很有创造力，在某个project中提出了一个feasible的想法，大大加快了project的进度。

  需要特别提到的是，推荐信是为申请服务的，而 gradute program 还是比较看重的在技术方面的能力（研究能力）的，因此即使是来自 industry 的推荐信，也尽量体现出你的这方面能力和潜力。
