Dawei Liu

---

Dear Admission Committee,

I am glad to write this letter of recommendation for Mr. Dawei Liu who is applying for your Master's programme. As a Visiting Professor at Northeastern University, where I teach "Big Data Technology", I have seen Dawei's impressive academic performance and technical expertise.

In the final project, he led the development of an intelligent blog website. This system was equipped with a novel recommendation algorithm called Trust SVD, which utilized users' social connections to improve recommendations. He developed five microservices with Java and Spring Cloud and deployed them on the Kubernetes cluster. Dawei's role in system design and implementation shows his deep understanding of big data technology and ability to convert theoretical concepts into practical solutions.

Dawei's leadership was equally important to the success of the project. He successfully completed the project within two weeks by implementing the Scrum methodology, organising daily stand-up meetings and using Trello for efficient project management. He helped team members solve problems they encountered during the coding process. He can effectively facilitate consensus in group discussions and ensure that each team member can contribute optimally, which has been essential to his teamwork.

It is worth noting that Dawei's achievements reach far beyond his academic pursuits. His success in software competitions demonstrates his skills in competitive real-world scenarios. For example, he applied what he learned from the course to develop a knowledge-sharing platform with the Trust SVD recommendation system, and won the First Prize in the ByteDance Youth Camp.

Dawei is an outstanding young man. He is precisely the kind of candidate who could benefit from, and significantly enhance, the vibrancy of an advanced academic programme. I am confident that his enrolment in your Master's programme will be mutually advantageous, and he will emerge as an influential figure in the field of computer science. 

In short, I give Dawei Liu my highest recommendation. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.
