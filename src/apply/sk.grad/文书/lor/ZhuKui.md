To the Admission Committee,

I am writing to extend my highest recommendation for Mr. Dawei Liu, who served as an intern under my guidance at JD.com. In my role as a Backend Software Development Engineer, I have had the privilege of witnessing first-hand the remarkable contributions and technical prowess that Mr. Liu brought to our team. His collaborative spirit, innovative problem-solving, and profound technical skills make him an exceptional candidate for any future role in software development and artificial intelligence.

Mr. Liu's internship at JD.com was marked by his significant contributions to the Yanxi AI development and computing platform. He showcased his expertise in Go and client-go, along with a deep understanding of Kubernetes Informer, in developing the resource management service. His approach to optimizing the resource recalculation process was nothing short of ingenious. By strategically splitting the resource group by namespace and user type, and implementing record locks to recalibrate smaller groups, he drastically reduced the system's overhead. By using the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing, He made the peak performance of resource recalculation 20 times faster. This method of counting the number of recalculations and only executing the most recent and ongoing tasks significantly improved the efficiency of our system.

Another notable project under Mr. Liu’s stewardship was the AI Pilot Marketing Platform. His proficiency in Java was instrumental in integrating AIGC services such as text2text, img2img, and text2img. The application of the Strategy Pattern in managing command options and his design of the user pipeline for the activity page generation workflow demonstrated his ability to seamlessly combine technical prowess with an acute understanding of user experience and process optimization.

Mr. Liu’s skills extend beyond software development to include a deep understanding and practical application of CI/CD workflows. His initiative to refactor our team's Jenkins workflows into a more efficient, container-native GitOps workflow using Argo Workflows and Argo CD was a testament to his forward-thinking and adaptability. This not only streamlined our development processes but also significantly improved our deployment and operational efficiencies, aligning our practices with the latest industry standards.

Perhaps most impressively, Mr. Liu displayed a level of conscientiousness and dedication that is rare in the tech industry. Faced with the challenging task of deploying the Yanxi AI platform for the China Construction Bank within a strict one-week deadline, he rose to the occasion. His development of the Helm chart for this deployment was critical. He meticulously analyzed the service dependencies and implemented Helm chart hooks to ensure an efficient and successful setup, showcasing his remarkable ability to perform under pressure and deliver high-quality work.

Throughout his internship, Mr. Liu consistently demonstrated a keen ability to grasp complex systems and think creatively to devise effective solutions. His collaborative spirit, especially evident in his work with our Machine Learning Engineers, made him an invaluable asset to our team. He approaches each task with a unique blend of enthusiasm, diligence, and technical acumen, setting a high standard for what we expect from our technical talent.

I strongly endorse Mr. Dawei Liu for admission to your master's degree program and am confident that he will prove to be a valuable asset to your academic community. Please feel free to contact me if you require further information or specific examples of his work and achievements.

Sincerely,
