My experiences in computer science, marked by curiosity and a relentless drive for discovery, has led me to explore various facets of this dynamic field. From the intricate world of of AI-driven application development to the innovative realm of AI for catalysts, my project and research experiences have shaped my desire to delve deeper into computer science, and I am excited to dive deeper into this field with the Master of Science in Computer Science program at Yale University

My decision to pursue further education in software development comes from my strong academic background established during my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University. There, I achieved a GPA of 3.955 and ranked top 1% in the Software College. My efforts were recognized with awards like the National Scholarship, Merit Student Scholarship, and Outstanding Student Pacesetter. Among various courses I have completed, Big Data Technology, Introduction to Recommendation System, and Fundamentals of Virtual Reality Technology were particularly influential for me. These classes sparked my interest in advanced software applications and its potential to enhance technology and solve complex problems.

During my internship at JD.com, one of the largest Fortune 500 technology giants in China, I contributed to the Yanxi AI Development and Computing Platform and the AI Pilot Marketing Platform. For the Yanxi platform, I refactored the resource management service to improve efficiency and scalability. By using the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing, I enhanced the peak performance of resource recalculation speed by 20 times. Moreover, I refactored the activity page AI auto-generation service for the AI Pilot Marketing platform. I organized the functions with the Strategy Pattern to generate each content floor with AIGC and LLM services effectively. Collaborating with machine learning engineers, UI/UX designers, and marketers, I helped design service options and workflows, sharpening my AI software skills and deepening my grasp of user-centered design. This experience allows me to see the transformative impact of AIGC in the real technology industry.

Additionally, at the ByteDance Camp, I developed an intelligent knowledge-sharing platform named 'Juejin', using the Trust SVD social recommendation system and was awarded the first prize. I also participated in the Mobile Application Innovation Contest, where my AR social app 'Trace Note' received the second prize, ranking fourth in the AR track among 2,287 teams. These experiences allowed me to put my skills into practice, lead teams, and see my innovative ideas come to life.

I have actively pursued research opportunities that span across various domains of computer science and intersect with other disciplines. At the City University of Hong Kong, I contributed to the TIMEDB bioinformatics data visualization project, by creating more than 10 interactive visualization plots and developing user-friendly responsive website. This experience honed my skills in data analysis and visualization, key components in understanding complex biological data sets. This project laid the groundwork for my interest in applying computational methods to real-world problems.

Currently, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I am part of a research team working on AI for catalysts. We utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to aid in the discovery of new photocatalysts. My role involves not only applying deep learning techniques but also collaborating closely with experts from different fields. This interdisciplinary project has not only strengthened my skills in AI and deep learning but also taught me the value of collaborative problem-solving across different scientific fields.

Looking ahead, I aim to start my career at a pioneering company like Google or Meta, renowned for their cutting-edge AI products. I want to be actively engaged in the lifecycle of AI-driven products and gain essential industry insights. In the long term, I aspire to establish my own AI-focused startup, dedicating myself to redefining daily workflows and improving life quality with innovative AI solutions.

Yale's MSCS program is an ideal match for me, providing the perfect platform to realize these ambitions. With its distinguished faculty, advanced research, and comprehensive curriculum, it offers an unparalleled opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and contribute to the AI application field. I am particularly drawn to the work being done in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Yale, which aligns closely with my research interests and career aspirations.

In short, my experience, backed by solid academics and real-world practice, fits well with my plans. I'm eager to join the MSCS program at Yale, where I can grow my passion for AI, work on innovative applications, and keep learning. I am confident that this program will play a pivotal role in helping me achieve my aspiration of making a meaningful impact through AI applications.
