# MSAII

- Unofficial transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received a degree.
- Current resume.
- Statement of Purpose. A Statement of Purpose is not a resume.  It should discuss your reasons for choosing the MSAII program and indicate your intended career path. 
- Three letters of recommendation.
- A short (1-3 minutes) video of yourself. Tell us about you and why you are interested in the MSAII program.  This is not a required part of the application process, but it is **STRONGLY** suggested.
