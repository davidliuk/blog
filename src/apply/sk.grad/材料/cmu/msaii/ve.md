# Video Essay

Optional, but strongly recommended

Prepare a 1-3 minute video that lets the admission committee know who you are, what you do well, and what you are looking to achieve in your graduate study at the LTI.

**Note:** that the video (and audio) must be of the applicant (not a proxy). If there is more than one person in the video, please clarify which person is the applicant. What you do or say is totally up to you as long as you provide the information requested.

If all else is equal, an applicant with a video essay will have an advantage over an otherwise identical applicant without a video essay.

Upload the video or provide a link below.
