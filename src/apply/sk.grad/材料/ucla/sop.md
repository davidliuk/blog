**Statement of Purpose for UCLA's Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence**

In a transformative era, AI is a fundamental force reshaping our world. From AI-generated content to large language models like GPT, AI is expanding the boundaries of creativity and innovation. With a strong interest in exploring the frontiers of AI application and development, I aim to pursue the Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence program at UCLA.

During my undergraduate at Northeastern University, I earned a 3.955 GPA and was ranked 5th out of 396 in the Software Engineering major. I was awarded the National Scholarship, Merit Student Scholarship, and Outstanding Student Pacesetter. Among the various courses I have completed, Big Data Technology, Introduction to Recommendation System, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence were the courses that stood out to me. These classes sparked my interest in AI and pushed me to think about how AI can be integrated into everyday technologies to improve user experiences and solve challenging problems.

During my internship at JD.com, the largest Fortune 500 technology giant in China, I participated in the development of the Yanxi AI Develop & Computing Platform and the AI Pilot Marketing Platform. For the Yanxi platform, I refactored the resource management service to improve efficiency and scalability. By using the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing, I made the peak performance of resource recalculation 20 times faster. Moreover, I refactored the activity page AI auto-generation service for the AI Pilot Marketing platform. I organized the functions with the Strategy Pattern to generate each content floor with AIGC and LLM services effectively. I also collaborated with Machine Learning Engineer colleagues to design the options and pipelines of the service, which strengthened my skills in AI-driven software solutions and deepened my understanding of user-centered design. This experience allows me to see the transformative impact of AIGC in the real technology industry.

I developed an intelligent knowledge sharing platform 'Juejin' with Trust SVD social recommendation system at the ByteDance Youth Camp and was awarded the first prize. I also participated in the Apple Mobile Application Innovation Contest with an AR social app 'Trace Note' and won the second prize, ranking top 4 in the AR track out of 2287 teams. These experiences were opportunities to put my skills into practice, lead teams and see my innovative ideas come to life. 

After graduation, my immediate goal is to join a company with advanced AI products like Google or Meta, to participate in the life cycle of AI-driven products. My long-term goal is to start my own AI company. I envision this startup revolutionizing daily workflows and improving people's lives.

Looking ahead, I chose UCLA MEng AI not only for its prestigious academic reputation, but also for its interdisciplinary learning environment. I look forward to taking your esteemed courses such as Machine Learning Algorithms and Natural Language Processing, where I can learn the core technology of AI applications. I am confident that UCLA's educational resources will provide me with the necessary support to achieve my academic and career goals.

We live in a transformative era where AI is not just an emerging technology but a fundamental force reshaping our world. From AI-generated images and videos to advanced systems like GPT, AI is redefining the boundaries of creativity and innovation. It's empowering diverse sectors, changing our daily lives, and reimagining the future. Amidst this rapid evolution of AI, my passion and curiosity have grown exponentially, guiding me to pursue the Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at UCLA.

My academic journey at Northeastern University, where I achieved a GPA of 3.94 in Software Engineering, laid the foundation for this pursuit. It wasnâ€™t just about the grades; courses like Human-Computer Interaction and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence were eye-openers to the endless possibilities of AI. They not only equipped me with a solid technical background but also fueled my aspiration to be a part of the AI revolution.

My internship at JD.com allowed me to witness firsthand the impact of AI in a real-world setting. Working on projects like the Yanxi AI Develop & Computing Platform and the AI-Pilot Marketing Platform, I was able to apply my academic knowledge to practical challenges, further cementing my interest in AIâ€™s transformative capabilities in the business world.

Leading innovative projects like â€˜Trace Noteâ€™ for the Apple Mobile Application Innovation Contest and developing a knowledge-sharing platform at the ByteDance Youth Camp, I not only showcased my technical expertise but also my ability to innovate and lead in the AI space. These experiences were not just milestones in my career; they were pivotal moments that reinforced my decision to delve deeper into the world of AI.

At UCLA, I am eager to immerse myself in an environment that is at the forefront of AI research and application. My goal is to explore and master areas such as machine learning algorithms and neural networks, which are essential for advancing AI technology.

In summary, my journey to UCLA's AI program is driven by a desire to be at the heart of the AI revolution, contributing to and shaping the future of this exciting field. This program represents more than just academic progression; it is the key to unlocking my potential as a leader and innovator in the world of AI.
