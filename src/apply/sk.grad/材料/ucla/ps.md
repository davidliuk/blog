# Personal Statement

***What is a Personal Statement and what is it used for?\***

The Personal Statement is an opportunity for you to provide additional information that may aid the selection committee in evaluating your preparation and aptitude for graduate study at UCLA, including your contribution to diversity. The statement will also be used to consider candidates for the Cota-Robles and Graduate Opportunity awards, which provide financial support to graduate students who make significant contributions to diversity. In the words of the [University of California’s Diversity Statement](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/4400.html), “Diversity – a defining feature of California’s past, present, and future – refers to the variety of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, and geographic region, and more.” The complete text of this statement can be found online.

***Instructions\***

Please respond to one or more of the following prompts, including at least one prompt speaking to your contributions to diversity. Your statement can be up to 500 words in length (approximately 1-page, single spaced, using 1-inch margins and 12-point font).

- Are there educational, personal, cultural, economic, or social experiences, not described in your Statement of Purpose, that have shaped your academic journey? If so, how? Have any of these experiences provided unique perspective(s) that you would contribute to your program, field or profession?
- Describe challenge(s) or barriers that you have faced in your pursuit of higher education. What motivated you to persist, and how did you overcome them? What is the evidence of your persistence, progress or success? 
- How have your life experiences and educational background informed your understanding of the barriers facing groups that are underrepresented in higher education?
- How have you been actively engaged (e.g., through participation, employment, service, teaching or other activities) in programs or activities focused on increasing participation by groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education?
- How do you intend to engage in scholarly discourse, research, teaching, creative efforts, and/or community engagement during your graduate program that have the potential to advance diversity and equal opportunity in higher education?
- How do you see yourself contributing to diversity in your profession after you earn your advanced degree at UCLA?

**1. Educational, Personal, Cultural, Economic, or Social Experiences Shaping My Academic Journey**

My academic journey has been significantly shaped by my cultural background and experiences as a Chinese student. Growing up in a society where education is highly valued, I was exposed to a rigorous academic environment from an early age. This experience instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for the power of education. Additionally, coming from a culture rich in tradition and history, I have learned to value diverse perspectives and understand the importance of cultural sensitivity in education. These experiences have not only shaped my academic pursuits but have also given me a unique perspective that I plan to bring to my program at UCLA. I believe that my background will allow me to contribute a distinct viewpoint to discussions and research, particularly in the field of educational inclusivity and diversity.

**2. Engagement in Activities Focused on Supporting Underrepresented Groups**

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in initiatives aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in higher education. As Secretary of the Academic Planning Center in College Student Union, I focused on creating inclusive educational programs for all students in need. I organized online study rooms and lectures, and servered as a Advanced Mathematics lecturer to help 200 students from 3 grades who were faced with difficulty in course study. About half of them are racial minorities or international students who might face language barriers or have limited access to academic support. I can still feel the great difficulties they faced. I well prepared 12 courses that cover most of the key knowledge points, and shared my detailed summary notes online to ensure that all these resources were accessible to them. Fortunately, most of my classmates made progress in the following quiz. My efforts were driven by a belief in equil education for all, regardless of their cultural or socioeconomic background.

**3. Plans for Engagement in Graduate Program to Advance Diversity and Equal Opportunity**

During my graduate studies at UCLA, I am also keen on contributing to teaching and mentoring programs, where I can use my experiences to support and inspire students from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, I aim to be involved in community outreach programs that work towards increasing awareness and participation in higher education among historically underrepresented communities. My goal is to leverage my academic work and community engagement to contribute to a more inclusive and diverse educational environment at UCLA and beyond.
