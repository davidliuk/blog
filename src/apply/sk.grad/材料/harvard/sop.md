The [statement of purpose](https://gsas.harvard.edu/apply/applying-degree-programs/completing-your-application/statement-purpose-and-writing-sample) is very important to programs when deciding whether to admit a candidate. Your statement should be focused, informative, and convey your research interests and qualifications. You should describe your reasons and motivations for pursuing a graduate degree in your chosen degree program, noting the experiences that shaped your research ambitions, indicating briefly your career objectives, and concisely stating your past work in your intended field of study and in related fields. **Your [degree program](https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-study/degree-programs) of interest may have specific guidance or requirements for the statement of purpose**, so be sure to review the degree program page for more information. Unless otherwise noted, your statement should not exceed 1,000 words.

Upload your statement of purpose as a Microsoft Word document or a PDF file. Please note that any website addresses included in your document will be passed along to the admissions committee as plain text. If you would like the committee to review the content of those websites, you may use the **Digital Portfolio** section of this application to upload website hyperlinks.
