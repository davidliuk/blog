Studying in China and the U.S. provides unparalleled exposure to diverse tech cultures and practices, preparing me for leadership roles in international tech environments. This program is the ideal match for my career, where I aim to contribute to AI advancements and eventually lead innovative projects in global tech companies.

Above all, the dual-country experience will deepen my technical knowledge and enhance my understanding of global tech trends. 

I am eager to learn and grow in such a dynamic and culturally rich environment. Thank you for considering my application.
