In a transformative era, AI is a fundamental force reshaping our world. From the complex world of AI-driven application development to the innovative realm of AI for catalysts, my project and research experiences have shaped my desire to delve deeper into this field, and I am excited to dive deeper with the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Dual Master of Science Degrees with a Concentration in Connective Media at Cornell Tech.

My decision to pursue further education at Cornell Tech comes from my strong academic background established during my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University. There, I achieved a GPA of 3.955 and ranked in the top 1% in the Software College. My efforts were recognized with awards such as the National Scholarship, Merit Student Scholarship, and Outstanding Student Pacesetter. Among the various courses I took, Big Data Technology, Introduction to Recommendation System, and Fundamentals of Virtual Reality Technology were particularly influential for me. These courses sparked my interest in advanced software applications and their potential to improve technology and solve complex problems.

During my internship at JD.com, one of the largest Fortune 500 technology giants in China, I contributed to the Yanxi AI Development and Computing Platform and the AI Pilot Marketing Platform. For the Yanxi platform, I refactored the resource management service to improve efficiency and scalability. By using the Observer Pattern and asynchronous computing, I increased the peak performance of resource recalculation speed by 20 times. Moreover, I refactored the activity page AI auto-generation service for the AI Pilot marketing platform. I organized the functions with the Strategy Pattern to effectively generate each content floor with AIGC and LLM services. Collaborating with machine learning engineers, UI/UX designers, and marketers, I helped design service options and generation workflows, sharpening my AI software skills and deepening my understanding of user-centered design. This experience allows me to see the transformative impact of the AIGC in the real technology industry.

In addition, at the ByteDance Camp, I developed an intelligent knowledge-sharing platform called 'Juejin' using the Trust SVD social recommendation system and won the first prize. A ByteDance engineer noted the careful design and innovative approach of our project. This project was a blend of complex front-end and back-end development, requiring a keen understanding of user interaction and technical functionality. My leadership role involved managing a team of four, encouraging creative solutions, and ensuring that each component of the platform was polished and functional. This experience enhanced my team management and project delivery skills, reflecting my ability to lead technically challenging projects.

I also participated in the Mobile Application Innovation Contest, where my AR social app 'Trace Note' received the second prize, ranking third in the AR track out of 2,287 teams. An Apple expert praised its potential, likening it to an early version of Facebook for the AR era. This praise highlighted our success in blending AR technology with social networking concepts. The interest from an investor, suggesting team expansion and investment, validated our concept's viability and the technical competencies of our team. My role involved coordinating efforts across various aspects of development, ensuring a harmonious blend of innovation and user-friendly design. These experiences allowed me to put my skills into practice, lead teams, and see my innovative ideas come to life.

I have actively pursued research opportunities that span across various domains of computer science and intersect with other disciplines. At the City University of Hong Kong, I contributed to the TIMEDB bioinformatics data visualization project, by creating more than 20 interactive visualization charts and developing a user-friendly responsive website. This experience honed my skills in data analysis and visualization, key components in understanding complex biological datasets. This project laid the foundation for my interest in applying computational methods to real-world problems.

Currently, I am part of a research team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University working on AI for catalysts. We are using Graph Neural Network models to aid in the discovery of new photocatalysts. I used a tuned PaiNN model on the OC20 dataset and achieved impressive results. This task involved fine-tuning to optimize the modelâ€™s performance for our specific research goals. We are currently exploring the use of GNNs to guide the study of photoelectrochemical water splitting in ferroelectric semiconductors, pushing the boundaries of AI applications in renewable energy research. This interdisciplinary project taught me the value of collaborative problem-solving across different scientific fields.

Looking ahead, I aim to start my career at a pioneering company like Google or Meta, renowned for their cutting-edge AI products. I want to be actively engaged in the lifecycle of AI-driven products and gain essential industry insights. In the long term, I aspire to establish my own AI-focused startup, dedicating myself to redefining daily workflows and improving life quality with innovative AI solutions.

Cornell Tech's Connective Media program is an ideal match for me, providing the perfect platform to realize these ambitions. With its distinguished faculty, advanced research, and comprehensive curriculum, it offers me an unparalleled opportunity to expand my knowledge and contribute to the AI application field. I am particularly attracted to the prestigious studio courses and the work in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, which align closely with my research interests and career aspirations.

In short, my experience, backed by solid academics and real-world practice, fits well with my plans. I'm excited to join the Connective Media program at Cornell Tech, where I can develop my passion for AI, work on innovative applications, and keep learning. I am confident that this program will play a pivotal role in helping me achieve my goal of making a meaningful impact through AI applications
