In this section, you will record yourself answering three questions that we will ask you through an online system. The questions are *not* technical in nature. Rather, the questions focus on your goals, professional and/or academic experiences, and your personal fit for the applied focus of the program.

- You will be given **15 minutes** to prepare and **5** **minutes** to record your answer. You should allocate approximately 90 seconds for each question
- You will only be given **ONE** opportunity to record your response
- You will answer all three questions in one video (DON'T CLICK ON STOP UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED)
