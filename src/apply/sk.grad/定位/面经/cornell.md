# Cornell

You will receive an email from CollegeNET containing the link to the interview session within **10 minutes after you submit the application**. The video interview questions are not technical questions. They are a series of random questions that will give the admission committee more insight of your preparedness, knowledge, and what you hope to gain from obtaining an MPS degree from Information Science at Cornell. 

In the interview, you will receive 3 questions and have 1 minute to respond to each one immediately. Your responses to the interview questions should complement rather than duplicate the content of your Statement of Purpose. Successful interviews are conversational rather than scripted or memorized. Before beginning the video interview, be sure you are in a private place where you will be undisturbed for 20-30 minutes. You will be given the opportunity to test your video and audio connection prior to starting the video interview. If you experience any difficulty with the interview, please email Barbara Woske at bae2@cornell.edu

The video interview must be received by January 5 for Fall applicants or October 11 for Spring applicants. Incomplete applications will not be considered.

1. Cornell Tech's unique aspect lies in its immersive, fast-paced learning environment that's deeply integrated with the tech industry. Particularly in the Connective Media program, the combination of a strong tech focus with media studies is unparalleled. Unlike other schools, Cornell Tech offers a hands-on, real-world approach, bridging academia and industry. This integration is vital for me as it aligns perfectly with my goal to blend AI with media technologies.
2. Working in a team is always enlightening. Recently, I enjoyed the diversity of ideas and perspectives in a project team. The challenge we faced was coordinating our different approaches and skills. We had a tight deadline for a complex task, but through open communication and leveraging each member's strengths, we successfully completed the project on time. This experience reinforced the value of teamwork and diverse skill sets in achieving goals.
3. Post-Cornell Tech, I plan to join a leading tech company, ideally in AI product development. My aspiration is to be involved in innovative projects, applying what I've learned to real-world applications. Eventually, I aim to leverage this experience to start my own AI-focused venture. This aligns with Cornell Tech's mission of fostering technology leaders and entrepreneurs. The program's blend of technical depth and entrepreneurial spirit is precisely the foundation I need for my career goals.
4. My interest in Cornell Tech's master's program was sparked by its unique approach to integrating technology with practical application. My experiences in AI development and leading innovative tech projects have prepared me for this. The opportunity to work in an environment that's at the forefront of technological innovation and closely connected with the industry is what draws me to this program.
5. In a multidisciplinary project, a colleague from a non-technical background brought a fresh perspective that challenged my approach. They emphasized the user experience, leading me to realize the importance of balancing technical prowess with user-centric design. This experience taught me to consider broader aspects beyond just the technicalities in my work.
6. Once, I initiated a tech project that ultimately failed due to underestimating the resources required. Despite the initial enthusiasm, we couldn't sustain the project. This was a hard lesson in planning and resource management. I learned the importance of realistic goal-setting and thorough preparation, insights that have been invaluable in my subsequent endeavors.

**Teamwork Experience at JD.com**: 

My internship at JD.com was marked by a collaborative and supportive team environment. The open culture allowed for free-flowing idea exchanges during brainstorming sessions. And my suggestions were valued and implemented. 

A notable challenge we encountered was incorporating lighting effects into AI-generated image for the AIGC service. Our development team initially lacked in-depth knowledge of lighting classifications and their impact on images. 

To bridge this gap, colleagues from the design team conducted art-focused educational sessions, to broaden our understanding in the art field. This cross-disci‘plinary approach led to the development of our effective solutions. We firstly defined the domain knowledge of all kinds of light effects with domain-specific language in the backend. And then used the control-net to control the light effects in the diffussion model. This experience illustrates the power of collaborative problem-solving across different expertise areas.
