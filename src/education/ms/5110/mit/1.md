## Finite Automata

- state: circle
  - start state: has a arrow from nowhere
  - accept state: double circles
- transition: arrow

Input: finite string

Output: Accept or Reject

Language of Machine

---

- $Q$: finite set of states
- $\Sigma$: finite set of alphabet symbols
- $\delta$: transition function
- $q_0$: start state
- $F$: set of accept states



String and languages

- A String is a finite sequence of symbols in $\Sigma$
- A language is a set of strings (finite or infinite)
- The empty string $\epsilon$ is the string of length 0
- The empty language $\empty$ is the set with no strings

Defn: $M$ accepts string 

Recognizing languages

- $L(M)=\{w|M accepts w\}$
- $L(M)$ is the language of M
- M recognizes $L(M)$

## regular languages

Defn: A language is regular if some finite automation recognizes it.

regular languages

## regular expressions

regular operations: Let A, B be languages

- Union: $A\cup B=\{w\in A \or w\in B\}$
- Concatenation: $A\circ B=\{xy|x\in A \and y\in B\}=AB$
- Star: $A^*=\{x_1...x_k|each\space x_i\in A\space for\space k\ge0\}$

Regular Expressions

- Built from $\Sigma$, members $\Sigma$, $\empty$, $\epsilon$ [atomic]
- By using $\cup,\circ,*$ [composite]
