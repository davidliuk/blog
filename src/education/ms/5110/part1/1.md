# Introduction

The theory of computation is concerned with algorithms and algorithmic systems: their design and representation, their completeness, and their complexity.

The purpose of these notes is to introduce some of the basic notions of the theory of computation, including concepts from formal languages and automata theory, the theory of computability, some basics of recursive function theory, and an introduction to complexity theory. Other topics such as correctness of programs will not be treated here (there just isnâ€™t enough time!).

The notes are divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to formal languages and automata. The second part deals with models of computation, recursive functions, and undecidability. The third part deals with computational complexity, in particular the classes P and N P.
