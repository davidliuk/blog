# Body Animation

**Keyframe**

Animation=Post(time)

Collections of motion curves

- Single degree of freedom(DOF)
- Single Joint (up to 6 DOF)
  - 3 rotation
  - 3 translation (if root or changing bone lengths)
- Entire body

Motion curve representation

- Usually cubic splines
  - Bezier (Catmul-Rom) splines
  - Bsplines

---

### Main Approaches to Animation

Keyframe

- Key poses specified at selected points in time

- Spline curves used to interpolate body position and

orientation between key poses

Mocap

- motion data representing position of root and joint angles as a function of time
  - No splines -> every frame a key


- Usually generated by capturing a live actor’s performance

Procedural

- IK-based (Ubisoft)

- Optimization-based

- Physically-based (Ragdoll)
  - Motions generated based on the law of physics

IK can change length of link

## Main Editing Techniques

### Warp

**Change Playback speed**

Given motion curve $m(t)$

$t=h(\tau)=s\cdot\tau$

### Blending

**blend two animation (lerp)**

$m(t_k)=(1-\alpha)m_1(t_k)+\alpha m_2(t_k),\alpha\in[0,1]$

### Cross Dissolve (linear blend)

**transition from one animation to another (lerp)**

$m(t)=(1-\alpha(t))m_1(t)+\alpha(t) m_2(t)$

$\alpha\in[0,1],t\in[t_1,t_2]$

$\alpha(t)=\frac{t-t_1}{t_2-t_1}$

### Foot IK

Allow characters walk over uneven terrain

IK target

Root position

- determine which foot is lower
- Update vertical position of root joint

Foot Position

- use Limb IK with Lfoot_target and Rfoot_target to position feet
