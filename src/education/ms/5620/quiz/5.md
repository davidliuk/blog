## Q1

Explain how to construct a bind matrix for each joint on a skeleton, and explain the space-to-space transformation each bind matrix applies to any mesh vertex. Your answer should be no more than two sentences.



## Q2

Compute the bind matrix for the skeleton joint with the overall transform shown below (you should leave it written as a sequence of individual matrices). Then, apply that bind matrix to a vertex located at the world-space position (2, 2).



## Q3

Adam has written a program that applies linear blend skinning to a mesh with a skeleton. However, when his skeleton moves its joints, the mesh does not move with them. Suggest one possible cause for this error in no more than one sentence.
