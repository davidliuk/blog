### IK Blending

Controls that actively use IK Blend are highlighted in the Viewer and the Character Controls:  

IK Blend can be animated by clicking the K in the Character Controls to set keyframes.    

Increasing IK Pull reduces the effect of other IK influences when theyâ€™re trying to achieve their  IK targets. For our purposes, this effect only works with IK Blend T outside of Full Body mode. 

### Body Mode

Body modes determine what is being keyframed and manipulated. You can visualize them by  selecting a control and seeing what highlights. The blue full body mode allows keying on the  whole body while only manipulating one body part.
