Curve Editor Coding Assignment

## Part 0

Development Environment Setup and Code Framework

(5 points) After getting your Visual Studio development environment setup and
downloading the assignment code framework from Github, the first task is making sure you can run the code on your machine and are able to use some debugging tools available in Visual Studio that would be beneficial in the later parts of the assignment. There are 2 errors in the assignment that you need to fix before getting started on the main parts:

a. When you run the code, try adding multiple key points by using Ctrl + Mouse Left
Click, and then try deleting them by using Mouse Right Click. You will need to
fix the unexpected deletion that then occurs.
b. On the curve editor GUI that comes up when you run the code,
choose the “Rotation” option, and then select “Cubic/Spherical Cubic” from the
dropdown: as soon as you do that, the program will crash. Try running the program in Debug mode and hitting “Retry” on the exception window to navigate to the error.
