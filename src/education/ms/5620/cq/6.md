In the widely popular game Minecraft, there are numerous modifications (mods) that add new dimensions to gameplay. I'm interested in creating a mod that transforms the player's character, Steve, into a magician, complete with a custom particle system to visually represent magical abilities. For this system, each particle needs to store certain data attributes (e.g. position) to function and render correctly within the game environment. What data attributes do you think are essential to include in each particle of the system? Please provide a list of these attributes with brief explanations of their relevance and how they contribute to the overall magical effect.

---

Position (x, y, z): Where each particle is in 3D space.

Velocity (vx, vy, vz): Speed and direction of the particle's movement.

Acceleration (ax, ay, az): Additional force, e.g., gravity or drag.

Color (r, g, b, alpha): Color and transparency of the particle.

Size: Scale or radius of each particle.

Lifetime: How long the particle exists before fading.

Rotation: The angle for particles with textures or patterns.

Texture: Specific image used for each particle, like a spark or glow.

Emission Rate: How often new particles are created.

Blend Mode: Determines blending effect, e.g., additive for glow.

Gravity Factor: Controls if and how much gravity affects the particle.

Trail: Adds lingering trails for flowing effects.

Opacity Fade: Controls fade-in and fade-out rates.
