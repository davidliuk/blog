EENT(Engineering ENTrepreneurship)

Engineers and scientists create and lead great companies, hiring managers when and where needed to help execute their vision. Designed expressly for students having a keen interest in technological innovation, this course investigates the roles of inventors and founders in successful technology ventures. Through case studies and guest speakers, we introduce the knowledge and skills needed to recognize and seize a high-tech entrepreneurial opportunity - be it a product or service - and then successfully launch a startup or spin-off company. The course studies key areas of intellectual property, its protection and strategic value; opportunity analysis and concept testing; shaping technology driven inventions into customer-driven products; constructing defensible competitive strategies; acquiring resources in the form of capital, people and strategic partners; and the founder's leadership role in an emerging high-tech company. Throughout the course emphasis is placed on decisions faced by founders, and on the sequential risks and determinants of success in the early growth phase of a technology venture. The course is designed for, but not restricted to, students of engineering and applied science and assumes no prior business education. Prerequisite: Third or Fourth year or Graduate standing

THE CLASSROOM DISCUSSION 

Depending on the nature of the case, the class is often conducted as a meeting of an advisory team to the decision-maker in the case, where you and your classmates are the advisors. The team’s objective is to recommend the best course of action and how to implement it. This recommendation is decided by healthy debate and discussion of pros and cons among the team members where the faculty member’s role is that of a facilitator. Classroom learning with the case method depends on your active and thoughtful participation in the team discussion. Although this is a group process, it does not imply conformity to group opinion. You should be willing to submit your views to rebuttal in a climate of constructive criticism, and overcome any fears of making and admitting a mistake. Each person will not necessarily have an opportunity to speak every day. Whether you speak or not on a given day, you will benefit by comparing your case analysis to that of others. Participation will be graded not by your amount of “air time” but by the quality and thoughtfulness of your comments. Near the end of the class session, the faculty member will summarize the discussion, highlight the useful lessons learned and, if applicable, provide a brief epilog to the case.
