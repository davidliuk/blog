2-PAGE ESSAY ASSIGNMENT

Each case may be the subject of either an in-class quiz or an essay assignment. If an essay is assigned, it must be submitted via the course web site prior the beginning of class. The essay must not exceed 2 pages with 1½ line spacing, 1-inch margins and size 12 font. Essay assignments are to be YOUR OWN WORK – the University’s guidelines for academic integrity will be strictly enforced: (https://next.catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).

Typically the essay assignment will ask that you briefly describe relevant facts about the situation at hand and then describe your proposed course of action and your reasons for choosing that course of action. Do not rehash the case. Do not simply repeat what happened in the case, but explain why it happened. Most of your essay should be devoted to explaining and defending your course of action. You should discuss the pros and cons of your decision, if appropriate to the context of the case, and then defend your decision.

Write your essay using business-style writing as opposed to scientific writing. In business writing, you lead with your conclusion and then present your underlying rationale and supporting facts for arriving at your position. The writing style should be action-oriented, making decisive statements and taking definitive positions. Write in the first person and use active voice, not passive voice. Scientific writing leads the reader through your approach and analysis, reaching a
suggested conclusion at the end. In business we often both start and end with our conclusion, providing strong logic in between.

Avoid the following pitfalls:

- Tomuch attention tminor issues.

- Lamenting over insufficient data and ignoring creative solutions.

- Rehashing the case -- assume the reader knows the case.

- Not appropriately evaluating the quality of provided data.

- Not being clear and concise, especially with quantitative analyses.

- Grade deductions are caused by essays that:

  - are submitted late (late submittals are usually not accepted),

  - exceed the 2 page limit,

  - lack clarity or are not concise,

  - use bullet-point lists instead of narrative essay format,

  - are not practical because of cost, timing or other implications,

  - reflect excessive personal bias and miss key issues, or

  - are poorly organized and/or not thoroughly proofread.
