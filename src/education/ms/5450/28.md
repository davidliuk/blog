**1. How would you define the personality of a manager compared to that of a leader?**
 A manager is rational, organized, and seeks stability; a leader is imaginative, emotionally driven, and comfortable with chaos.

**2. How would you define the workplace objectives of a manager compared to those of a leader? How do they perceive their respective roles in the company?**
 Managers aim to maintain order, efficiency, and meet goals; leaders aim to inspire change, innovate, and set new directions.

**3. Describe a manager‚Äôs relationships with others. What about those of a leader?**
 Managers build structured, role-based relationships with low emotional involvement; leaders form deep, empathetic, and transformative relationships.

**4. Describe a manager‚Äôs sense of self. What about that of a leader?**
 Managers derive self-worth from maintaining and improving systems; leaders derive identity from challenging the status quo and personal vision.

**5. How do managers develop? How do leaders develop? How do ‚Äúonce born‚Äù and ‚Äútwice born‚Äù types relate?**
 Managers develop through socialization into existing systems ("once born"); leaders develop through inner struggle and personal transformation ("twice born").

**6. From your observations of start-up founders in EAS545 this semester, when is the article relevant or not?**
 Relevant when founders had to inspire teams under uncertainty; less relevant when success depended purely on executing established plans.

**7. Overall, to what extent would you agree or disagree with the author's point of view?**
 I mostly agree; the distinction between leaders and managers explains many observed startup dynamics, although real individuals often blend both traits.

**8. How does this article relate to the previous article in terms of defining the qualities and role of a leader?**
 Both articles highlight vision, risk-taking, and intrinsic motivation as defining leadership traits, contrasting leaders with efficiency-focused managers.

**9. The article emphasizes that it is important for a leader to ‚Äúbehave in a way that is consistent with who you are.‚Äù Explain.**
 Authenticity builds credibility and endurance; leaders who act contrary to their true selves eventually lose effectiveness.

**10. ‚ÄúDrawing on a deep moral sense‚Äù is important for a leader for what reasons?**
 It provides strength to persist through adversity and anchors decisions in values beyond short-term gains.

**11. A function of leadership is ‚Äúabsorbing uncertainty.‚Äù Explain.**
 Leaders shield their teams from fear and indecision, enabling progress despite unknown outcomes and risks.

**12. What six elements define the framework for assessing the characteristics of a leader? Which have you encountered in EAS5450?**
 The six elements are imagination, commitment, joy, governance, tempered creativity, and tolerance for seeming foolish.
 We saw imagination, commitment, and absorbing uncertainty in startup founders and guest speakers throughout the semester.

**13. How do these articles relate to: (i) EAS5450 case studies; (ii) guest speakers; and (iii) classroom discussions?**
 (i) Cases highlighted the tension between managing operations and leading growth.
 (ii) Guest speakers often embodied leadership traits, especially vision and risk tolerance.
 (iii) Discussions emphasized leadership's role in innovation and managing ambiguity.

**14. Using the principles presented in our readings for today, describe yourself. Are you a leader or a manager?**
 I am more of a leader: I enjoy creating new ideas, thrive under uncertainty, and prefer setting visions rather than managing existing systems.
