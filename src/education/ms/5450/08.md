# 08: Lean Startup, Dropbox

For today’s class, we will learn about the principles of The Lean Startup and reinforce the concepts with the Dropbox case. Read “[**Hypothesis-Driven Entrepreneurship: The Lean Startup**](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/639dbab6)”. Think through the following study questions as you read this article:

- Why is being a “lean startup” important to an entrepreneur?
- What is an “MVP” and what is its role in a startup’s product development process?
- What are the three other approaches to launching startups described and how do they differ from the lean startup approach?
- What are falsifiable hypotheses and why are they critical to hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship?
- What is the objective of each step in the hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship process? How is the process advantageous in helping to decide whether to persevere, pivot or perish?
- Cognitive biases can lead to irrational decision behavior. To what such biases are entrepreneurs particularly susceptible and how can we mitigate their influences?
- The existence of certain “boundary conditions” may limit the effectiveness of the lean startup process. What are they and, if they exist, how do you deal with them?
- Under what circumstances would the lean startup approach not be effective?

Read the article, "**[Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything)**", which endorses the lean start-up principles and then the article, "[**The Limits of the Lean Startup Method**](https://hbr.org/2016/03/the-limits-of-the-lean-startup-method)", which speaks to the need for constraints when adopting the lean start-up principles.

Next, read and prepare for discussion the case, [**Dropbox: ‘It Just Works’**](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/tu/9a487727) (HBS 9-811-065).

Think about how you would answer the following study questions during your analysis of the case:

- What experiences and principles guided Dropbox product development?
- How did Dropbox utilize the principles of hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship lean start-up, which we read earlier?
- What contributed to the strategy of targeting individual users (consumer and business) with a single version?
- What marketing tactics did Houston use to drive adoption and why did they appear to work? Why did paid advertising not work as well?
- Should Houston change Dropbox's product strategy to develop product versions with features for specific customer segments?
- How did Houston mitigate the cognitive biases to which he may have been susceptible?

**DUE:**

Following the guidelines in the Case Method Overview (posted in Canvas Files), write a concise 2-page essay addressing the question:

**To what cognitive biases are entrepreneurs particularly susceptible? How did Dropbox mitigate them to achieve success? Provide specific examples from the case.**

Submit your essay via Canvas prior to class. This essay must be your own work subject to the University’s Code of Academic Integrity.

**1. Why is being a “lean startup” important to an entrepreneur?**

A lean startup minimizes waste by testing hypotheses early and iterating based on feedback, reducing the risk of building unwanted products. It accelerates learning, enabling entrepreneurs to pivot or scale efficiently. For example, Dropbox validated demand with a demo video (MVP) before full development, saving time and resources.

**2. What is an “MVP” and its role in product development?**

An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the simplest version of a product to test core hypotheses. Its role is to gather validated learning with minimal effort. Dropbox’s MVP was a video demonstrating sync functionality, which attracted 75,000 beta sign-ups, proving market interest without building the full product first.

**3. Three alternative approaches to launching startups:**

- **Build-It-And-They-Will-Come**: Relies on vision without customer validation (e.g., Segway). Differs from lean startup by ignoring early feedback.
- **Waterfall Planning**: Sequential, rigid stages (design → develop → test). Lacks the iterative, feedback-driven cycles of lean methods.
- **Just Do It!**: Improvisational and reactive, but lacks structured hypothesis testing. Lean startups balance flexibility with disciplined experimentation.

**4. Falsifiable hypotheses in hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship:**

These are specific, testable claims (e.g., “30% of users will pay $10/month”). Critical because they force objective validation. Dropbox tested hypotheses like “users will refer others for free storage,” which led to refining their viral referral program.

**5. Hypothesis-driven process steps and advantages:**

- **Steps**: Envision → Hypothesize → Test → Learn → Decide (persevere/pivot/perish).
- **Objective**: Reduce uncertainty through iterative validation.
- **Advantage**: Data-driven decisions. For example, Dropbox pivoted from paid ads to organic growth after tests showed high acquisition costs.

**6. Cognitive biases and mitigation strategies:**

- **Optimism Bias**: Dropbox used MVP metrics (e.g., beta sign-ups) to validate demand.
- **Confirmation Bias**: A/B tests on referral incentives (250MB vs. 500MB) countered assumptions.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Abandoning unproductive partnerships despite prior effort.
- **Planning Fallacy**: Adjusting timelines based on user feedback (e.g., 18-month delay to fix usability).

**7. Boundary conditions limiting lean startup effectiveness:**

- **High-Stakes Environments** (e.g., medical devices): Use simulations and phased testing.
- **Long Development Cycles** (e.g., hardware): Prototype iteratively.
- **Regulatory Constraints**: Engage regulators early. Dropbox navigated storage costs by optimizing features like file versioning.

**8. When lean startup is ineffective:**

- **Inelastic Demand** (e.g., life-saving drugs): Less need for validation.
- **Radical Innovations** (e.g., first smartphones): Customer feedback may be unreliable.
- **Winner-Takes-All Markets** (e.g., social networks): Speed-to-market trumps iteration.

In such cases, hybrid models or modified lean principles (e.g., rapid scaling post-validation) may apply. Dropbox succeeded by blending lean methods with strategic pivots, demonstrating adaptability within constraints.
