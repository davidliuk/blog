## 2. Main Contribution

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of level set methods, originally developed by Osher and Sethian, which are used for tracking interfaces and shapes in computational physics. It discusses key advancements, including fast computational techniques, applications to physics-based problems, and extensions to multiphase motion. The authors present various numerical approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications like fluid dynamics, computer vision, and image processing.

## 4. One Thing I Liked

One of the most interesting aspects of this paper is how level set methods seamlessly handle topological changes, such as merging and breaking apart of interfaces, without requiring explicit intervention. This feature makes them highly effective for problems involving complex dynamic surfaces, like fluid flows and evolving shapes in image processing.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

While the paper provides a solid theoretical foundation and numerous applications, some sections feel overly technical without enough intuitive explanations for readers unfamiliar with the field. The reliance on heavy mathematical formulations without sufficient visualization or step-by-step derivations can make it challenging for newcomers.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. Could you elaborate on the computational efficiency of level set methods compared to alternative approaches like phase field models or front tracking in large-scale simulations?
2. Are there specific real-world engineering applications where level set methods have been successfully implemented but not covered in this paper?
