## 2. Main Contribution

This paper introduces a new method for real-time crowd simulation based on continuum dynamics. Unlike traditional agent-based models, which simulate individual pedestrians separately, this approach treats the crowd as a continuous flow governed by dynamic potential fields. This allows for more natural and efficient navigation, integrating both global path planning and local collision avoidance into a single framework. The model is computationally efficient, enabling the simulation of thousands of individuals in real time while still capturing complex emergent behaviors like lane formation and vortices in dense crowds.

## 4. One Thing I Liked

One of the most interesting aspects of this paper is how it integrates both global and local planning in a seamless way. Instead of having to balance between individual decision-making and macro-level crowd behaviors, the continuum approach ensures that all pedestrians follow an optimal path while naturally adjusting to congestion. This results in visually smooth and realistic movement patterns without the unnatural jitter or myopic behaviors often seen in agent-based simulations. The ability to capture emergent phenomena like lane formation and vortex-like movement in large-scale crowds is particularly impressive.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

While the model performs well in structured environments with clear goals, it seems less suited for scenarios where individuals act independently or unpredictably. Since the approach is based on a potential field guiding the entire crowd, it assumes that all pedestrians have similar objectives. This may limit its ability to simulate diverse behaviors, such as groups moving at different speeds, pedestrians stopping or changing their goals mid-way, or highly interactive social behaviors. Additionally, the paper does not discuss how well the method scales in highly dynamic environments where obstacles move in real time.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. Since the model relies on a global potential field, how does it handle highly dynamic environments where obstacles move unpredictably, such as cars in a city or sudden blockages?
2. Could this method be extended to incorporate individual decision-making, such as different walking speeds, preferences for certain routes, or hesitation in movement?
3. The paper demonstrates lane formation and vortices as emergent behaviors. Are there other natural phenomena in real crowds that this model fails to capture?
4. How does the computational cost scale when increasing the resolution of the potential field? Would a finer grid allow for more detailed behaviors, or does it introduce diminishing returns?
