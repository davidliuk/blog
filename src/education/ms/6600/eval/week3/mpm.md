## 2. Main Contribution

This paper introduces a Material Point Method (MPM) specifically designed to simulate the complex behavior of snow. The authors propose an elasto-plastic constitutive model that captures both solid-like and fluid-like properties of snow, allowing for realistic effects such as clumping, breaking, and packing. By leveraging a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, the method naturally handles topological changes, self-collision, and fracture without requiring additional heuristics. The paper demonstrates the model's effectiveness through various simulations, including rolling snowballs, snowplows, and character interactions.

## 4. One Thing I Liked

I found the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach particularly effective in handling the unique challenges of snow simulation. The ability to represent both fluid-like and solid-like behaviors in a single framework is impressive. The visual results, such as snowballs packing and shattering realistically, demonstrate the power of the proposed model. The paper also provides clear comparisons to other methods, showing why traditional fluid or rigid body solvers fall short in capturing snowâ€™s complex behavior.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

While the paper presents compelling results, it does not include a detailed performance analysis comparing MPM to alternative methods in terms of computational efficiency. Given that MPM can be computationally expensive, it would have been useful to see benchmarks showing how well the method scales with increasing resolution or particle count. Additionally, some of the equations, particularly those involving the constitutive model, are presented without much intuitive explanation, which makes them harder to follow for readers unfamiliar with continuum mechanics.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. Given the computational demands of MPM, did you explore any optimizations or GPU acceleration to improve performance for large-scale snow simulations?
2. The paper discusses parameter tuning for different types of snow (e.g., powdery vs. packed). Could you provide more insights into how these parameters were chosen and whether they can be automatically adjusted based on environmental conditions?
