## 2. Main Contribution

The paper introduces a physics-based control strategy for bipedal walking that generalizes well across different gait parameters, character proportions, motion styles, and various walking-related skills. The proposed method integrates proportional-derivative (PD) control for motion tracking, an inverted pendulum model for foot placement, Jacobian transpose control for gravity compensation and velocity adjustments, and inverse kinematics for limb movements. The framework enables real-time simulation with robust and adaptable locomotion, making it accessible for novice users to author customized walking motions.

## 4. One Thing I Liked

I found it impressive how the proposed method generalizes across a wide range of characters, gaits, and walking tasks without requiring extensive manual tuning. The ability to create and edit motion styles interactively, even for novice users, makes this approach particularly useful for animation and game development.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

One limitation of the method is its focus on slower, dynamically-balanced motions, making it less suitable for highly dynamic or acrobatic movements. Additionally, while the method provides robust balance recovery from pushes, it does not allow for user-defined "push recovery styles," limiting control over how characters react to disturbances.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. How would the system perform if applied to highly dynamic activities such as running, jumping, or martial arts? Could the existing framework be extended to handle such cases?
2. Since the method relies on simplified models like the inverted pendulum, are there any specific scenarios where the generalization breaks down, such as uneven terrain or highly asymmetrical character designs?
3. How does the computational efficiency of this approach compare to deep learning-based motion synthesis methods? Could machine learning be integrated to enhance adaptability further?
4. Given that the method enables user-driven style authoring, how well does it compare to traditional keyframe animation in terms of control and realism?
