## 2. Main Contribution

This paper presents a novel approach to fluid simulation using the Position Based Dynamics (PBD) framework. The authors introduce a method for enforcing incompressibility by solving a set of positional constraints rather than using traditional force-based models. This allows for stable and efficient fluid simulations with larger time steps, making real-time applications more feasible. Additionally, the paper incorporates an artificial pressure term to improve particle distribution and surface tension effects, as well as a vorticity confinement technique to reduce energy loss.

## 4. One Thing I Liked

One of the most interesting aspects of this paper is its ability to achieve stable and visually plausible fluid behavior while allowing for much larger time steps than traditional SPH-based methods. This is crucial for real-time applications, such as video games and interactive simulations, where computational efficiency is a key concern. The use of artificial pressure to prevent particle clumping and introduce surface tension is also a clever and practical solution to a common problem in particle-based fluid simulation.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

While the paper presents an effective method for fluid simulation, it does not delve deeply into potential trade-offs between accuracy and performance. The approach allows for larger time steps but does not discuss in detail how this affects fine-scale fluid behaviors such as splashing or turbulence in highly dynamic scenarios. Additionally, the use of artificial pressure, while beneficial, introduces a heuristic component that may require manual tuning for different simulation settings. More discussion on parameter selection and its impact on different types of fluids would have been useful.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. How does the artificial pressure term compare quantitatively to traditional SPH pressure solvers in terms of accuracy? Have you tested cases where strong external forces (such as wind or object interaction) influence the fluid behavior?
2. Would it be possible to extend this method to multiphase fluids, such as oil and water mixtures? If so, how would the constraint solver need to be adjusted to handle different densities and interaction forces?
