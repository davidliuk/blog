## 4. One Thing I Liked

One of the most interesting aspects of the paper is its structured approach to categorizing neural rendering methods. It clearly differentiates between 2D and 3D-based techniques, making it easier to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The discussion on how neural representations enable more realistic and controllable scene synthesis is particularly insightful. The inclusion of a taxonomy helps in grasping the evolution and current landscape of neural rendering research.

## 5. What I Did Not Like

While the paper provides an extensive overview, it can be quite dense and challenging to digest, especially for readers who are not already familiar with computer graphics and deep learning. Some sections, particularly those explaining mathematical foundations, could have been simplified or supplemented with more intuitive visual explanations. Additionally, the discussion on real-time performance improvements is somewhat limited, despite its significance for practical applications in gaming and virtual reality.

## 6. Questions for the Authors

1. Many neural rendering techniques rely on large-scale training data. How do you see the future of data-efficient neural rendering models that require minimal supervision?
2. The paper discusses several applications, but what do you think is the most promising near-term real-world use case for neural rendering beyond entertainment and gaming?
3. Given the ethical concerns mentioned, do you foresee any regulatory frameworks emerging for neural rendering technologies to prevent misuse in misinformation or deepfake generation?
4. Are there any fundamental limitations in current neural rendering models that you believe cannot be overcome with incremental improvements, requiring a paradigm shift in approach?
