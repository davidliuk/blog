## Outline

SigGraph Paper Presentations should include the following slides:

1. Title, authors, and their affiliations.
2. An overview of your presentation
3. The principal thesis of the paper.
4. A review of the background work leading to the interest in or need for the paper

     - What relevant topics/concepts are known from your previous coursework in graphics and animation and the class primers?
     - What new concepts will you need to define?
     - You should provide enough background materials to make the paper accessible to your audience.
5. An outline of the major topics of the paper.
6. Descriptions of the major algorithms, techniques, experiments, etc. contained in the paper. You don't need to derive formulas, but you should be able to motivate how they were created.
7. Questions for the Authors. What are questions that you would ask the authors? Things that are missing or unclear; experiments that might have exposed flaws, etc.
8. Paper Evaluation. Are the results convincing? Did they compare their results to other work? To reality? Did they use timings or complexity measures? Is either one missing? Why? Do the methods appear worthwhile to try to re-implement? Is the work significant (in some way)? Are the lines of research for future interesting or just curiosities?
9. Summarize the contributions (again), in the light of any criticisms from (7) and (8).
10. Would you have accepted this paper for the SIGGRAPH conference? ( in the form of thumbs up or thumbs down)

NOTE: Check the videos/demos that accompany the paper and plan to show the important features/highlights/results in class. It might not be a bad idea to check the websites of the authors to see if additional supporting material, images, animations, or slides also are readily available.
