# Authoring Tool: RigNet

不能直接用作者开源的代码，用了就F，需要自己实现一遍


Based on your selections, I think the paper “RigNet: Neural Rigging for Articulated Characters” would provide an interesting basis for an authoring tool and may be reasonable to implement. However, as with all machine learning-based approaches, access to a suitable training data set is one of the keys to success.  Before you commit to this paper, please confirm that such a training data set is available and that you can get access to it.

Here are your next steps:

1. Create a High Concept doc for the Authoring Tool – Due Thurs., Feb. 12th
   - Please use the attached template for your High Concept Doc


2. Create a Literature Survey for your Authoring Tool Design Doc – Due Wed., Feb. 19th

   - In order to create the Literature Survey, you will need to read the papers referenced in the paper you have chosen to implement, then chain backwards through a number of levels of references until you identify/reach the seminal work(s). Once the seminal work(s) have been identified, you can then chain forward to trace the evolution of the research. In this document you need to include a tree-like graph showing the evolution of the research from the seminal work to the paper you have chosen to implement along with descriptions of the enhancements/improvements/contributions made by each of the subsequent works.
   
   
      - Examples of the Literature Survey can be found in the Modules/Authoring Tool/Literature Survey Example section of the CIS6600 Canvas site
   
   
      - Also see the attached article by Patrick Cozzi on Moving Graphics Research to Development
   


3. Create an Authoring Tool Design Doc – Due Monday, Feb. 24th 

   - Please use the attached template for your Authoring Tool Design Doc
   
   
      - Examples of the past Authoring Tool Design Docs can be found in the Modules/Authoring Tool/Design Doc Examples section of the CIS6600 Canvas site. 
   
   
      - Check out the attached list of third party software that you might consider using in your authoring tool project.
