Just a reminder that the Wed class this week is a Design Review of the Alpha version of your Authoring Tool.  As with the Design Doc review, here’s the format I would like you to follow in a 4 minute presentation. 

NOTE: you should have no more than 4 slides.

**Slide 1 - Overview**

- Name of your Authoring Tool

- Group Members

- Title and authors of selected paper

**Slide 2 – Main Features**

- As a quick review, a **VERY BRIEF** description (i.e. less than 1 minute) of the main concept of your authoring tool

**Slide 3 - Results** **=> this is the most important section of your presentation**

- Progress to Date

- Demo, videos and/or screen shots showing what has actually been accomplished

**Slide 4 – Next Steps**

- Remaining tasks/features to be implemented

- What specifically you think you will be able to author with the final version of your tool

### **Slide 8: Next Steps**

"Looking ahead, we have several improvements planned:

- We want to switch to our own implementation of **GMEdgeNet**. For alpha version we 
- We'll also begin **training our own model weights**, tailored to specific character types or styles.
- And we plan to add **shape categorization**, so the model can automatically adjust based on the character type.

### **Slide 9: Usability Features**

"InstaRig is built with usability in mind:

- Users can control the rigging process through **intuitive GUI parameters**.
- We also support Maya’s **built-in rigging and skinning tools** for further refinement.
- To simplify setup, we’ve added an **installer** for dependencies and **auto-loading** within Maya.

These features are aimed at making InstaRig ready for production pipelines."
