Just a reminder that the Wed class this week is a Design Review of the Beta version of your Authoring Tool.  As with the Alpha Version review, here’s the format I would like you to follow in your 4 minute presentation. 

 

**NOTE**: you should have no more than 4 slides.

**Slide 1 - Overview**

- Name of your Authoring Tool

- Group Members

- Title and authors of selected paper

**Slide 2 - Results** **=> \*this is the most important section of your presentation\***

- Progress to Date
- Demo, videos and/or screen shots showing what has actually been accomplished

**Slide 3 – Next Steps**

- Remaining tasks/features to be implemented
- What specifically you think you will be able to author with the final version of your tool

## Scripts

当然，这里是你这一页 PPT（**Next Step – InstaRig**）的讲稿草稿，适合在汇报中使用，语气专业但不冗长，大概 1~2 分钟：

**Slide Title: Next Step – InstaRig**

“Moving forward, we have a few key features and improvements planned to enhance the usability and robustness of InstaRig.”

**Upcoming Tasks**

 “First, we plan to introduce an *intuitive bone editor*. This will give users the ability to manually remove or adjust any unnecessary or misidentified joints after the initial auto-rigging process, which is especially useful for complex or stylized models.

Next, we’ll be implementing *batch processing support*, allowing users to apply the rigging pipeline to multiple models in a single workflow. This is especially useful for studios or teams working with large character libraries.

Finally, we’re adding *FK/IK rigging options*, so users can generate animation-ready controls directly within the tool. This makes the rigs more compatible with common animation pipelines and game engines.”

**Final Deliverables**

 “Our end goal is to deliver a tool that *automatically creates skeletons and applies skinning* based on the input model geometry, with minimal need for manual intervention.

We’ll also support *batch rigging*, so teams can process assets at scale efficiently.

To ensure flexibility, users will be able to *control and edit skeletons through parameters or direct manipulation*.

And finally, we’ll provide a *simple installer and onboarding guide*, so artists and animators can quickly integrate InstaRig into their existing workflow.”
