### Q1

3

An out variable from vertex shader outputs data is interpolated across the primitives and then provided as input to the in variable in the fragment shader for each pixel.

### Q2

3

position arrays contains 18 elements;
normal arrays contains 18 elements;
Index array arrays contains  24 elements

### Q3

2

CPU-side code indicates to the GPU which GPU-side objects to use by binding them with functions like glBindBuffer, glBindTexture, or glUseProgram, effectively telling the GPU which objects to operate on next. The CPU cannot directly access GPU-side objects because they reside in separate memory spaces; direct access would be inefficient and is abstracted away by the graphics API to manage communication over the bus efficiently.

### Q4

4

The first line binds the buffer object `bufPos` as the current vertex buffer, making it the source of vertex data for subsequent operations.
The second line specifies that shader attribute `attPos` should read its data from the bound buffer, interpreting each vertex attributes as a four-component floating-point vector.
This tells the GPU how to fetch and interpret vertex data from the buffer during rendering.
