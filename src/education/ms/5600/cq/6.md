### Question 1

**The vertex indices of the half-edge's start and end vertices**: 

A half-edge \( HE \) has a start vertex \( $V_1$ \) and an end vertex \( $V_2$ \). Its SYM pointer points to another half-edge that travels in the opposite direction, meaning the SYM of \( HE \) should have start vertex \( $V_2$ \) and end vertex \( $V_1$ \). Therefore, knowing the vertex indices (start and end) allows you to identify the correct half-edge as the symmetric counterpart. In the implementation part, we could leverage hash map and `pair<vertex*, vertex*>` to get these mapping relationships.

### Question 2

1. **Function that determines the primitives drawn:**
   
   The **`Drawable::drawMode()`** function determines the primitives (e.g., triangles, lines, points) that will be drawn. 
   
   In current case, it returns `GL_TRIANGLES`, meaning the mesh will be drawn using triangles. Depending on the return value, different primitive types like lines (`GL_LINES`) or points (`GL_POINTS`) can be specified.
   
2. **What does `Drawable::getIndexBufferLength()` return?**
   
   The function **`getIndexBufferLength()`** returns the number of indices in the index buffer.
   
3. **Where is this value used?**
   
   This value is used in the **`glDrawElements()`** OpenGL function. It tells OpenGL how many indices are present in the index buffer and thus how many elements (e.g., triangles or lines) should be drawn during rendering.
