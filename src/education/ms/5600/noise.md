# Procedure Noise

## Fractal Brownian Motion

producing smooth motion that appears random, yet much less noisy than purely random:

Sum your noise function at different amplitudes, increasing the functionâ€™s frequency as amplitude decreases

Bilinear interpolation 

## Worley

**Grad-based**

Optimizing

Min distance of nerghbor 9 point

## Perlin Noise

**Grad-based**

Not recommend Bilinear interpolation: too clear line between cells
