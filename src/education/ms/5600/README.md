# Interactive Computer Graphics

This course focuses on programming the essential mathematical and geometric concepts underlying modern computer graphics. Using 3D interactive implementations, it covers fundamental topics such as mesh data structures, transformation sequences, rendering algorithms, and curve interpolation for animation. Students are also introduced to two programming languages widely used in the computer graphics industry: C++ and GLSL. The curriculum is heavily project-based, and culminates in a group project focused on building an interactive first-person world exploration application using the various real-time interaction and rendering algorithms learned throughout the semester.

Just to confirm, if I need to use extension for an emergency, I just push a README.txt in the repo stating that I'm using a one day extension before ddl. Do I need to do anything on Canvas?

Nope, pushing to the repo that you want to use a late day is sufficient!
