## Observation & Reference

**Work Big to Small**

Big shapes and reads first. Medium, noticeable details next. Fine, close details at the end.

- Style is one thing, but you need to define what's important first
- You do not **need** to focus on realism, but you **absolutely must** focus on textural detail, plausibility and cohesiveness. 

**Observation checklist**

- **Form**
  - Straight-edged or curved?
  - Convex or concave? 
  - Organic or rigid?
  - Made of one continuous form, or different components held together somehow? 
  - Are there areas of contrast? Continuity? Positive and negative space? 

- **Light**
  - What is the color tone of the light? Is it direct or diffuse? 
  - How many shadows are there? What are their shapes and quality?
  - How does light interact with the surface? Is anything reflective, refractive, or subsurface? 
- **Scale**
  - What measurements can I collect? 
  - How does it feel in comparison to other objects? 
  - Does the camera capture depth of field? Atmospheric perspective?
  - How does weathering feel at this scale? 

- **Weathering**
  - Is it new or old? Clean or grimy? 
  - Are some parts weathered and other parts dusty? 
  - What do the imperfections say about this object’s history? 
  - Does the weathering affect multiple levels of the surface? 
    - Does a scratch on an old car cut through gloss, paint, and metal? How does that affect different parameters, like the bumpiness or reflectivity? 
- **Roughness & Glossiness**
- **Subsurface Scattering**
- **Scale & Perspective**
- **Details have scale, too!**

**Attention to Detail**

- The truth of a story is in the details.

**Reference is always required!**

- **Reference Photos**
  - Required
  - In focus and not terrible

**How to Start a Model**

- Take reference images (+ measure)
- Understand what you’re making
- Start simple

**Taking Reference Photos**

- Well lit
- Clear enough to see details
- Try to have simple background
- Line up with each other (Photoshop)
- Take from a distance + zoom

**Focal Length**

**Reference Planes**
