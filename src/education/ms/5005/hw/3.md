# Project 3: Detail Modeling for Interactive Media

- **Due** Tuesday by 11:59pm
- **Points** 25
- **Submitting** a file upload

For the last project, you will explore beyond the camera lens to create a detailed object or small scene that is designed to be viewed at any angle or distance in an interactive environment. You will learn how to model at different levels of detail, build upon previous modeling experience to create topology that holds up to close inspection, design detailed, multi-layered materials using Substance Painter, use mesh map baking processes to generate normal maps, and learn about real-time render optimization. For your final deliverable, you will create a Sketchfab account to upload your model for browser-based viewing and sharing.
