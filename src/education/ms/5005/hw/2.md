#### **1. Concept & Overview**

I will create a modern **kitchen interior**. The design is inspired by contemporary kitchen spaces, with sleek white cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, and a polished, elegant look. The kitchen environment will have a clean, organized layout with functional workspaces. Lighting will play a crucial role in setting a warm, natural ambiance, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

This environment will be based on a **modern kitchens** from observable references I find at art station: a contemporary apartment kitchen. The mash-up will combine the elegant, polished feel of a home kitchen with the professional-grade equipment and layout efficiency of a chef's kitchen.

#### **2. Asset List**

- Cabinets and Drawers: Sleek, handle-less cabinets for a minimalist look.
- Kitchen Island: Central island with black granite countertops and a couple of modern stools.
- Stove & Oven: Built-in stainless steel stove and oven.
- Decorative Plants: Small potted plants to add a touch of greenery and life to the space.
- Lighting Fixtures: Modern ceiling lights and under-cabinet lighting for a cozy, illuminated environment.

**Hero Model**: A polished, central **kitchen island**, featuring a large countertop with bar stools around it, serving as the main focus of the room.

#### **3. Reference Image Board**

The reference imagery used for this environment comes from high-end interior design examples. These references highlight the clean, modern lines, high-contrast materials, and ambient lighting, as seen in the uploaded images. These images capture the essence of the space, including the sleek cabinetry, polished countertops, and minimalist yet cozy decor.

#### **4. Basic Model Example**

One of the key elements of this environment is the **kitchen island**. For the pitch, I present a basic model of the island, showcasing its dimensions and shape. The model will focus on the island’s overall form, including the countertop and the bar stools. This model will demonstrate how the hero model will serve as a central feature in the final environment, integrating form and function.
